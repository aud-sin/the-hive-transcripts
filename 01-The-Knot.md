# Episode 1 - The Knot
---
Tie the knot, you can’t untie. Tie the knot, you can’t untie. Tie the knot, you can’t untie. Tie the knot, you can’t untie. Tie the knot, you can’t untie. Tie the knot, you can’t untie.

**LUMINARY**
 Good morning, Tetra. Welcome to your first lesson.

**INTERROGATOR**
 Sloane? Samantha Sloane? Are you even listening to me?

**SAMANTHA**
 Hmm?

**INTERROGATOR**
 I’d advise you stop daydreaming and try to understand the gravity of your situation. I’m here to find out what led the CIA’s top cyber-operations officer down a path of terrorism.

**SAMANTHA**
 I’m not a terrorist.

**INTERROGATOR**
 And what do you call what went down at Langley yesterday? A prank? Let’s start from the beginning. Why were you trying to find Eli Cooper?

**SAMANTHA**
 I’d like my medicine now.

**INTERROGATOR**
 Not a chance.

**SAMANTHA**
 I have a photosensitivity condition that makes it difficult to concentrate with that flickering light... um, if you want this interrogation to go well.

**INTERROGATOR**
 This is not an interrogation. This is a friendly chat. When we decide it’s time to interrogate you... you’ll know it. Now. From the beginning.

**SAMANTHA**
 It started four and a half weeks ago. I gathered intelligence that an American hacker was trading zero-days for explosives. I tracked him down to a suburb outside Annapolis. And I was on the ground with SWAT when they went to apprehend him.

**SWAT LEADER**
 Target’s name is Alan Dubeck. He’s the subject of an intelligence operation run by our CIA liaison here. Do her best to stay out of our way while she does... Exactly what will you be doing?

**SAMANTHA**
 I’m monitoring his network traffic to see if he’s on his computer. There’s no point in arresting him if he has time to hit a kill-switch.

**SWAT LEADER**
 I’m sorry. Are you wearing headphones right now?

**SAMANTHA**
 I’m listening to music. It helps me focus. It’s also very loud in here.

**SWAT OFFICER**
 CIA always sends fucking weirdos, right?

**SWAT LEADER**
 Well, when we get there, stay in the van. It’s gonna be a whole lot louder once we get to work.

**SWAT OFFICER**
 [Over radio] Got eyes on Dubeck. Second story.

**SWAT LEADER**
 Check your mags, boys. Weapons hot. Let’s move!

**SAMANTHA**
 Wait, stop!

**SWAT LEADER**
 What?

**SAMANTHA**
 There’s just a sudden spike in activity inside Dubeck’s house. A bunch of new devices just appeared all at once.

**SWAT LEADER**
 So what? We gotta move.

**SAMANTHA**
 So don’t open the door! He could have just triggered—

**SWAT OFFICER**
 God... god... The whole fucking house just exploded.

**SWAT LEADER**
 Sloane! Stay in the truck!

**SAMANTHA**
 They found what was left of Alan Dubeck in what was left of his house. ATF investigators ruled a suicide. They weren't sure what he was planning to do with the explosives, but they concluded that he detonated them when he saw SWAT coming. They recovered fragments from at least seven laptops in the rubble. But only one was intact enough to pull data from. It’s what I found on that laptop that led me to Eli Cooper.

**MARCOS**
 Look who’s back at work. I thought that explosion would keep you off your feet for at least a week.

**SAMANTHA**
 I need to talk to you.

**MARCOS**
 Uh... we were actually just heading out to Sullivan’s, it’s trivia night. Why don’t you come with? Have a beer? We can talk there.

**SAMANTHA**
 I don’t drink. It dulls the senses and impairs memory.

**MARCOS**
 Yeah, Sloane. That’s kind of the fucking point.

**MARCOS'S COLLEAGUE**
 Marcos, we're going to be late.

**SAMANTHA**
 I need you to look at this now.

**MARCOS**
 God damn it. Fine. I’ll meet you guys there.

**SAMANTHA**
 Forensics got back to me with the image of Alan Dubeck’s hard drive. Does the name Eli Cooper mean anything to you? He's the CEO of Marathon, one of the biggest cybersecurity firms in the world. And he was the last person to talk to Alan Dubeck before he died.

**MARCOS**
 Really? In what context?

**SAMANTHA**
 They were working together. Seemingly for years. Look at all these decrypted chat logs. They’re all extremely brief and devoid of any meaningful details. They clearly didn’t want to leave a written record. But there are multiple references to something called "The Hive". I don’t know if that’s a program, a person, or a place, but whatever it is... Alan was involved with it right up until he died.

**MARCOS**
 What about all those audio files? What’s on those?

**SAMANTHA**
 Um... not exactly sure what to make of these.

**AUDIO FILE VOICE**
 [Distorted, rhythmic male voice] Tie... not... can't... tie... tie... not... can't... tie... tie... not... not... can't... tie...

**SAMANTHA**
 As far as I can tell, that’s Dubeck’s voice you’re hearing. It goes on like this for hours.

**MARCOS**
 What the fuck?

**SAMANTHA**
 I think Dubeck was just the beginning of something much bigger. I want to keep digging into Eli Cooper, Marathon, and whatever this "Hive" is. I put together an operational plan for you to review. And I’ll need an alias.

**MARCOS**
 An operational plan? Are you kidding me? Sloane, listen to this guy. He’s fucking nutty bananas.

**SAMANTHA**
 But Eli Cooper was working with him on... on something...

**MARCOS**
 So what? Cybersecurity firms work with black-hat hackers all the time.

**SAMANTHA**
 They work with social engineers or zero-day miners. Not people buying millions of dollars worth of explosives. This is a matter of national security.

**MARCOS**
 National security... Pfft. This guy was probably just trying to blow up the local Starbucks cause the barista wouldn’t fuck him. There is not nearly enough here to justify running a domestic operation on an American citizen.

**SAMANTHA**
 There’s something very suspicious about Eli Cooper. He never shows his face in public and he erased all record of his past before Marathon. You can’t come from nowhere and build a cyber-security firm like that from thin air. You need talent. Elite, expensive hackers. There are rumors he could have off-the-books financiers. Maybe foreign interests.

**MARCOS**
 I don’t care if he got his startup funds directly from Bin Laden’s will. The only thing that’s gonna get me more blowback than an op on an American citizen, is an op on a rich American citizen. Make it the FBI’s problem, then forget about it, and get back to your job. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’ve probably already missed the first round of trivia.

**INTERROGATOR**
 But you didn’t leave it at that, did you? Instead, the next day, you requested a meeting with Michelle Anderson. The retired Senior Officer. What was your connection with her?

**SAMANTHA**
 Michelle is my mentor. She got me into the game. She’s the only person I really trust.

**YOUNG GIRL**
 Grandma! That boy pushed me down!

**MICHELLE**
 Come here, let me see. Oh, you’re okay. Walk it off. But listen... if he tries to push you down again, you remember what I taught you.

**YOUNG GIRL**
 Elbow him in the privates?

**MICHELLE**
 Good girl. Go play.

**SAMANTHA**
 She’s gotten so tall.

**MICHELLE**
 Yeah, well. What can I say? Good genes.

**SAMANTHA**
 I called because I need your help. I have a domestic ops plan that I need sign-off on, including a request for an alias. Do you still have connections at the DO?

**MICHELLE**
 You’re coming to me, that means your supervisor already said no. You’re not very good at making friends, are you?

**SAMANTHA**
 Marcos hates me. They all do.

**MICHELLE**
 They hate you because you’re good, Sam. At this age, you’ve already gathered more valuable intelligence than I did in my entire career. You’re the most valuable asset the Agency has. That can be a problem for some of the egos over there.

**SAMANTHA**
 Whatever the reason, he’d never sign off on this.

**MICHELLE**
 This would be your first time working undercover, wouldn’t it? You sure you’re up for that?

**SAMANTHA**
 You’re worried about me.

**MICHELLE**
 Nah. I don’t give a shit about you. I just don’t want to have to find a new park bench companion.

**SAMANTHA**
 I’ve done the training. I know the risks. I am prepared.

**MICHELLE**
 Still. You want me to find someone who will sign off on an alias for a domestic op, no questions asked? That’s not a small request, Sam.

**SAMANTHA**
 Michelle, I am on to something huge here. I just need a tiny bit of runway to pursue it. A week. No noise. No blowback. I’ve done a lot of good work for the company. Things nobody else could have done. And now I want to... I believe the phrase is, "cash in a favor"?

**MICHELLE**
 Well fuck it. I’ve never seen you like this before. But I think I like it. I’ve got some favors I can cash in myself. Someone at the DO will reach out to you. Just don’t make me look bad. At my age, legacy’s all I’ve got.

**SAMANTHA**
 I won’t. Thanks, Michelle.

**MICHELLE**
 What do you need friends for anyway, when you got me?

**SAMANTHA**
 Michelle came through for me. By that evening, I had an alias. Samara Walker. At which point, I was ready to get to work.

**INTERROGATOR**
 And what did that entail?

**SAMANTHA**
 I went home. I made a pot of Chankonabe soup. Sumo stew. It’s the perfect meal before an extended hacking session. Seventy grams protein, fish cakes for omega-3s, and lots of leftovers. Input determines output. Then I put on my music. You know I can’t work without my music.

**SAMANTHA**
 And then... I was Samara Walker. A troubled juvenile hacker with a history of minor run-ins with the law. Her online presence reveals hobbies including shit-posting crypto-memes. The kind of person who would break into Amerabank’s system just to see if they could.

**INTERROGATOR**
 Amerabank? I’m sorry. You hacked the largest bank in the world?

**SAMANTHA**
 Well, it took me fifteen minutes to breach the first level of the network. A misconfigured web chat application, another thirty to crack a hash to reach the elevated user level. Move laterally. Scan vulnerabilities. Escalate privileges. Repeat. It takes an hour to gain root access. At which point...

**SAMANTHA**
 Hello?

Hi, Samara.

**SAMANTHA**
 Who is this?

This is Marathon. The security firm representing the bank you are currently breaking into.

**SAMANTHA**
 Uh... I have no idea what you’re talking about.

No worries. Let me fill you in. Your name is Samara Walker and your current location is 3160 Montana Ave, Apartment 26. Information we’ve already shared with our incident management team who works closely with local and federal authorities.

What you’ve just done is a violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, which, given your prior convictions and the evidence we’ve already secured, will net you between fifteen and twenty years in prison. Yikes.

**SAMANTHA**
 If that’s the case... why am I not in handcuffs yet?

Your transgressions have made an impression here. And we hate to let good talent go to waste.

**SAMANTHA**
 So this is a job offer?

Something like that. There’s a coding test being held at our DC campus tomorrow afternoon. Why don’t you come in and show us what you can do?

**SAMANTHA**
 An in-person test?

These days you just can’t trust anyone online, you know? Of course, if you’re not interested, we can always go that other route. Hope to see you soon.

**INTERROGATOR**
 You wanted Marathon to catch you. You were setting a trap.

**SAMANTHA**
 In the cyber-security world, when someone knows how to beat your system, you don’t put them in jail. You put them on payroll. Is the fastest way to get close to Eli Cooper.

**INFORMATION KIOSK**
 Welcome to Marathon Security. What would you like to know more about?

**INFORMATION KIOSK**
 About our founder. Marathon was founded by Eli Cooper.

**RECEPTIONIST**
 Ms. Walker? I’ll take you back for your 3:30 coding test now.

**SAMANTHA**
 Um, it’s only 3:27?

**RECEPTIONIST**
 Yes, but you need to go through security screening first.

**SAMANTHA**
 I’d like to finish watching this video if I can.

**RECEPTIONIST**
 Um... Ms. Walker. The coding test will begin with or without you.

**SAMANTHA**
 I understand. I’m just... very interested in learning about the history of Marathon.

**RECEPTIONIST**
 Okay. Well... whenever you’re ready. I guess.

**INFORMATION KIOSK**
 Mr. Cooper is known for his extreme generosity. He recently donated over four hundred million dollars in supplies to DC area schools.

**SECURITY GUARD**
 So, uh... you don’t want to take the retinal scan?

**SAMANTHA**
 I’m asking if there’s an alternative. I’m extremely photosensitive. The flash of light that close would be, um... debilitating to me.

**SECURITY GUARD**
 Oh. Well. If it’s a medical condition... Is there anything else you need?

**SAMANTHA**
 Uh, I’d also like to hold on to my phone. I can put it on airplane mode or whatever you need. I just... need a certain kind of music to perform at my best.

**SECURITY GUARD**
 Mmm. I see. Well, unfortunately, Ms. Walker... as much as I’d love to make these exceptions... what we teach here is that making exceptions for people like you is how systems get compromised.

**SECURITY GUARD**
 So, if you want to take another step into this building, you’ll take the retina scan. You’ll leave all your devices here with us. And I think we may take a few extra precautionary measures because your behavior seems awfully suspicious to me.

**SAMANTHA**
 I’m already running late...

**SECURITY GUARD**
 Hmm. That’s a real shame. Put your eye up to the scanner. Now, please. Or I’ll be escorting you from the building.

**SECURITY GUARD**
 There you go. And...

**SECURITY GUARD**
 This is Samara Walker. She is here for the 3:30.

**PROCTOR**
 I’m sorry, but the test started quite some time ago. It’s almost over.

**SAMANTHA**
 Oh, I’m a fast worker. Is this laptop for me?

**PROCTOR**
 Insist. The data set is pulled up for you. You need to find and exploit the vulnerability in the next... four and a half minutes. Good luck.

**SAMANTHA**
 Uh, sorry. I have a question.

**PROCTOR**
 Yes?

**SAMANTHA**
 The videos on the information kiosk in the lobby talked about Marathon’s founder, Eli Cooper? If I do well on this test, would I get to work with him?

**PROCTOR**
 It’s possible. Yes. Any other questions? No? Great.

**PROCTOR**
 Giving up already, Ms. Walker? Next time make sure to get here early.

**SAMANTHA**
 Oh, no. I finished the test.

**PROCTOR**
 You... what?

**SAMANTHA**
 I actually uploaded the answers directly to your computer to save you the trouble of walking all the way over here again.

**PROCTOR**
 But... how did you do that?

**SAMANTHA**
 If you have a chance, can you please put in a good word for me with Eli? Sorry again for being late.

**SAMANTHA**
 After the test, I left Marathon’s campus. And—

**INTERROGATOR**
 Hold on a second, go back. How did you beat the coding test like that?

**SAMANTHA**
 I don’t have time to walk through every detail from the last four and a half weeks. While we’re here having a friendly chat, Eli Cooper is out there planning his next move. He’s highly motivated and extremely violent and nobody is doing anything to stop him.

**INTERROGATOR**
 Right. So you’ve mentioned. You know... you never really answered my question. Why were you so eager to make contact with Eli Cooper?

**SAMANTHA**
 I told you. He was the last person to speak with Alan Dubeck. And Marathon’s suspicious finances—

**INTERROGATOR**
 Cut the crap. Didn’t wash with Marcos and it won’t with me. What was your real motive for going after Eli Cooper?

**SAMANTHA**
 I didn’t have any motives! I was just... doing my job.

**INTERROGATOR**
 Tell me again about the strange audio recordings you found on Alan Dubeck’s hard drive. Did those have anything to do with it?

**SAMANTHA**
 No. Those were just gibberish. They weren’t relevant.

**INTERROGATOR**
 I’ll decide what’s relevant in this case. And I have good reason to believe that they are relevant. Especially after looking through your medical record.

**SAMANTHA**
 My medical record?

**INTERROGATOR**
 It’s more extensive than I’ve ever seen on an active CO. It’s a wonder you were still employed to begin with.

**SAMANTHA**
 It’s never affected my job performance.

**INTERROGATOR**
 There was one entry that stood out to me. A year ago at Harris Teeter in Arlington, you had some kind of seizure. Went on for several minutes. An ambulance was called. The medics on the scene said that you were... chanting... while you were unconscious. You kept repeating these nonsense phrases. "The Hollow Jungle"? "The Ascendant"?

**INTERROGATOR**\NAnd this is what really caught my eye. Something about... "A knot you can’t untie". Here’s what I think. You have some sort of personal connection to this case. You went out looking for Eli Cooper for your own reasons. You needed something from him. What was it?

**SAMANTHA**
 I was just doing my job.

**INTERROGATOR**
 What were you really there for? What is the Hollow Jungle? And what do you know about this?

**AUDIO FILE VOICE**
 Tie... can't... tie... not... can't... tie... tie... not... can't... tie... tie... not... can't...

**INTERROGATOR**
 Sloane?

**AUDIO FILE VOICE**
 Tie...

**INTERROGATOR**
 Sloane!

**AUDIO FILE VOICE**
 Tie... the knot... you can't... untie... Tie the knot, you can't untie...

**AUDIO FILE VOICE & SAMANTHA**
 Tie the knot, you can't untie. Tie the knot, you can't untie. Tie the knot, you can't untie. Tie the knot, you can't untie. Tie the knot, you can't untie. Tie the knot, you can't untie.

**INTERROGATOR**
 Sloane! Sloane?

**LUMINARY**
 Good morning, Tetra. Welcome to your first lesson.

**TETRA**
 Who’s Tetra?

**LUMINARY**
 You are.

**YOUNG SAM (TETRA)**
 But my name is Sam. Sam Sloane.

**LUMINARY**
 In this place, your name is Tetra. Think of it like a game.

**YOUNG SAMANTHA (TETRA)**
 Why do I have to wear this helmet?

**LUMINARY**
 It’s all part of the game. You like games, don’t you?

**YOUNG SAM (TETRA)**
 I guess.

**LUMINARY**
 Well this... this is a fun one. You see that box in front of you? To win the game, all you have to do is open the box.

**YOUNG SAM (TETRA)**
 I can’t do it! It’s tied shut!

**LUMINARY**
 Tetra. If you can’t open the box... you’ll lose.

**YOUNG SAM (TETRA)**
 I can’t untie it!

**LUMINARY**
 You don’t have to untie it. You just have to get it open.

She can’t do it.

**YOUNG SAM (TETRA)**
 Who is that?

**LUMINARY**
 The Ascendant.

**THE ASCENDANT**
 But she will learn.

**YOUNG SAM (TETRA)**
 What’s going on? What are you doing?

**LUMINARY**
 We’re helping you. We’re going to make you better, Tetra.

**THE ASCENDANT**
 Stand back. Luminary.

**INTERROGATOR**
 Sam? Are you okay?

**SAMANTHA**
 Yeah... fine.

**INTERROGATOR**
 Your nose... you’re bleeding.

**SAMANTHA**
 I’m fine.

**INTERROGATOR**
 All right. Well. We’ll come back to that. For now, let’s pick up where you left off. After the coding test. Now your supervisor said he spoke to you that night and that the conversation ended abruptly. That was the last time anyone from our side had contact with you. Until yesterday.

**SAMANTHA**
 Hi, Marcos.

**MARCOS**
 Sloane? What the hell were you thinking?

**SAMANTHA**
 What is this regarding?

**MARCOS**
 I told you to leave the Dubeck thing alone! And now I find out you went over my head to get authorization? You are on thin fucking ice!

**SAMANTHA**
 I gotta go.

**MARCOS**
 What? Don’t you dare hang up—

**SAMANTHA**
 I just got back to my apartment when I realized someone was inside.

**INTERROGATOR**
 How did you know that?

**SAMANTHA**
 Because they were singing.

See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance... will you, won't you...

**INTERROGATOR**
 Were you armed?

**SAMANTHA**
 I had my service weapon in the car.

**INTERROGATOR**
 You didn’t bring it with you?

**SAMANTHA**
 Walking through the door with a CIA issued handgun would blow my cover.

**INTERROGATOR**
 You’d rather risk your life?

**SAMANTHA**
 I’d rather stay on mission.

Will you join the dance? will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the dance? See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance... Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the dance?

**SAMANTHA**
 You're Eli Cooper.

**SAMANTHA**
 What are you doing in my kitchen?

**ELI COOPER**
 You know, according to ancient Greek legend, there was once an impossibly complex knot on an ox cart in Gordium. Did you know this? It was said that whoever could untie it would be destined to rule Asia.

**ELI COOPER**
 Now, Alexander the Great was challenged to untie the knot. But instead of untangling it... he sliced through it with his sword. Huh? Now, tied the knot probably thought Alexander was a cheating piece of shit. But he still went on to conquer Asia.

**SAMANTHA**
 I’m familiar with the story. What are you doing in my apartment?

**ELI COOPER**
 Oh, I’m just cutting some of your ginger root. I thought I’d make us some tea.

**SAMANTHA**
 I don’t like people touching my kitchen utensils.

**ELI COOPER**
 And I don’t like people touching my systems, but that’s exactly what you did to me, isn’t it? You hacked my system to beat the coding test.

**ELI COOPER**
 Relax. Come on, I’m not the feds. Do you know how I know you hacked us?

**SAMANTHA**
 Because the test was impossible to beat.

**ELI COOPER**
 Bingo. Not in thirty minutes, even by the most skilled coder, and certainly not in thirty seconds. Listen. I’m not looking for people who play by the rules, okay? I’m looking for Alexanders.

**SAMANTHA**
 Why did you come here, Eli?

**ELI COOPER**
 Come on. I had to know how you did it, of course. The test was hosted on our closed internal network, air-gapped from the test laptops. It should have been impossible for you to hack us from them.

**SAMANTHA**
 It would have been impossible to get into your network from the test laptops, that’s correct. But it wasn’t impossible from the information kiosk in the lobby.

**ELI COOPER**
 Now, now, now! That is very impressive. Hey, hey! A toast to your brilliance?

**SAMANTHA**
 What is this?

**ELI COOPER**
 I'm working on a special project. It’s called The Hive. I think what we’re doing there would be of a lot of interest to you. And this... this is the door.

**SAMANTHA**
 A cup of tea?

**ELI COOPER**
 Come on, it’s not caffeinated if that’s what you’re worried about. It’s almost the opposite, in fact.

**SAMANTHA**
 What did you put in it?

**ELI COOPER**
 Hmm. Something that kills Samara Walker... and allows her to be reborn as part of something bigger.

**SAMANTHA**
 It’s almost my bedtime and I don’t like riddles. If that’s all you have for me, I’d like you to leave.

**ELI COOPER**
 Well, what kind of gentleman would I be if I didn’t oblige? I’m happy to leave. But if I do... you’ll never see me again. And you know what? You’ll never get the answers you really want. Will you? Why you’re so alone. Why you’re so broken. And who broke you?

**ELI COOPER**
 You know what? You have a lovely kitchen, by the way.

**SAMANTHA**
 Wait.

**SAMANTHA**
 How much of this do I need to dr—?

**ELI COOPER**
 Welcome to The Hive.
