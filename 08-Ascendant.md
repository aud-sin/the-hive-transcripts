# Episode 8 - Ascendant
---
**LUMINARY**
 Good morning, Tetra. Welcome to your fourth lesson.

**LUMINARY**
 There is a box on the table in front of you. All you need to do is open it.

**LUMINARY**
 It's tied shut.

**LUMINARY**
 You’ll have to find a way in.

**LUMINARY**
 You remember what that helmet does if you don’t comply? Hmm?

**LUMINARY**
 She's not cooperating.

**LUMINARY**
 Standing back... and...

**YOUNG SAM (TETRA)**
 Stop.

**LUMINARY**
 Yes?

**LUMINARY 2**
 Watch out! Watch out, she's got a knife!

**LUMINARY 3**
 Where'd you get that from?

**YOUNG SAM (TETRA)**
 There. It's open.

**THE ASCENDANT**
 That's good work, Tetra. Finally, someone uses the knife.

**YOUNG SAM (TETRA)**
 You knew I had a knife?

**THE ASCENDANT**
 Of course. We're on the same team, after all.

**NIA**
 He’s going after the fucking kids.

**BROOKS ALDER**
 I got to call my son’s school.

**NIA**
 With what?

**BROOKS ALDER**
 They said they donated 400,000 dollars of laptops? How many even is that? How many schools is that?

**BROOKS ALDER**
 We have to get back to civilization. Find a phone. Get them all evacuated.

**SAMANTHA**
 It's fifteen minutes to 9:00 AM. And it would take longer than that to get to the nearest town.

**SAMANTHA**
 There's no way we could warn people in time. Our only chance is to find Eli and put an end to this.

**NIA**
 Let's get moving then. Preferably to a room that doesn't have a bomb in it.

**BROOKS ALDER**
 Let's check this room.

**LUMINARY**
 Input determines output.

Ugh. Mine tastes like dirt.

Smells.

**BROOKS ALDER**
 It's clear.

**SAMANTHA**
 This was the food hall.

**NIA**
 Only if you’re being super generous with your definition of food.

**BROOKS ALDER**
 Come on. Let's keep moving.

Quiet.

What?

**LUMINARY**
 There's consequences for everyone.

**YOUNG GUS (BEETLE)**
 I can't take it.

**NIA**
 The box.

**SAMANTHA**
 They kept all 50 of us in here.

**SAMANTHA**
 Do you hear that?

**NIA**
 The charming exotic ambiance?

**SAMANTHA**
 Underneath it, there's a... buzzing.

**BROOKS ALDER**
 It's coming from down this hallway.

**BROOKS ALDER**
 What are all these rooms?

**NIA**
 I... am not going down there.

**BROOKS ALDER**
 Are you okay?

**NIA**
 I'm fine. You guys go check it out. I'll wait right here.

**NIA**
 Nia... we need you. We do this together.

**NIA**
 Okay.

**BROOKS ALDER**
 What is this place?

**NIA**
 It’s where they experimented.

**BROOKS ALDER**
 Those wires hooked up to the generator look new. Eli’s?

**SAMANTHA**
 Yeah. They probably run to where he broadcasted his interview from.

**BROOKS ALDER**
 Broadcasted... so he has a signal set up in here?

**BROOKS ALDER**
 Too bad we don't have a computer. We could probably connect to that, huh?

**SAMANTHA**
 We do have a computer.

**BROOKS ALDER**
 What?

**NIA**
 Eli's laptops are all connected to the same network. Including the one we saw in the lobby.

**BROOKS ALDER**
 Wait, you want to hack into the bomb laptop?

**SAMANTHA**
 If we can get into the laptop, we can connect to the others.

**NIA**
 And find a way to disarm them.

**BROOKS ALDER**
 Well, what are we waiting for? Let's do it. Let's go.

**BROOKS ALDER**
 Get down!

**NIA**
 Fuck!

**GANNON**
 It's over! Come on out!

**SAMANTHA**
 Shit! Gannon.

**BROOKS ALDER**
 He's got us pinned down in this room. He's got a lot more bullets than I do.

**NIA**
 That's why I hate working with fucking arms dealers.

**SAMANTHA**
 We need to get to that laptop.

**NIA**
 I can do it. I'll run back.

**SAMANTHA**
 He'll shoot you the second you leave this room.

**BROOKS ALDER**
 Not if I give you covering fire.

**GANNON**
 Is y'all fucking hearing me? I said come on out! I'm not a patient man and I do not have time to waste!

**NIA**
 Let's do it.

**BROOKS ALDER**
 Nia... I don't know how this works, but... if for some reason you can't defuse all the bombs?

**BROOKS ALDER**
 My son goes to John C. Calhoun Middle School. I need to know that...

**NIA**
 He'll be okay, Brooks. Trust me.

**BROOKS ALDER**
 Okay. Okay. On three then.

**GANNON**
 You out of time!

**BROOKS ALDER**
 One. Two. Three!

**SAMANTHA**
 Brooks? Brooks!

**SAMANTHA**
 Come on, Brooks!

**GANNON**
 Back away from him! Now!

**NIA**
 You bastard!

**GANNON**
 There you go. And here I thought I missed my chance to kill you.

**ELI COOPER**
 Will you... Won't you... Will you... Won't you...

**ELI COOPER**
 Ah. Samantha. You're just in time to join the dance.

**GANNON**
 She's all yours. The spook she came with is dead. Just got one more loose end to go tie up.

**ELI COOPER**
 Ah, I'm betting you've never been in here before.

**ELI COOPER**
 I mean, look at all these monitors.

**ELI COOPER**
 Most of the cameras have stopped working by now but back in the day... Ooh, they had every inch of this place covered.

**ELI COOPER**
 The Ascendant used to sit right there, wheeling around in a rolly chair as they watched you all suffer.

**ELI COOPER**
 Oh... I'm sorry about Brooks. Sending my thoughts and prayers, of course.

**ELI COOPER**
 Hmm. You don't want to talk? That's fine. We can just enjoy each other's company.

**SAMANTHA**
 When you saw this place... did you feel guilty?

**SAMANTHA**
 You're doing all of this because you're such a great father.

**SAMANTHA**
 But you're the one that put him in here. Was he just too annoying to have around?

**SAMANTHA**
 You know, I bet when Oxcart shut down and they came to tell you that he'd killed himself or whatever story they came up with...

**SAMANTHA**
 you were so eager to take their money.

**ELI COOPER**
 You fucking think I wanted to take their money? I would never put him in here if I had any other—

**ELI COOPER**
 You almost got me angry there, Sam. That's what you want, isn't it?

**ELI COOPER**
 Ooh, nice try. Nice try. I mean, get me upset enough to give you some little opening to exploit, right?

**ELI COOPER**
 That was a good try but... you know what they say. Life's too short to stay angry.

**SAMANTHA**
 No. You're right. They didn't buy your silence.

**SAMANTHA**
 You took their money under threat.

**SAMANTHA**
 And if you don't take the CIA's carrot, they got just as good of a stick.

**SAMANTHA**
 They probably did everything they could to humiliate you.

**SAMANTHA**
 And they probably reminded you that even if you could expose the truth... so what?

**SAMANTHA**
 Like you told me once... they ain't exactly Doctors Without Borders.

**SAMANTHA**
 So when you met Alan Dubeck, who was also investigating Oxcart, the two of you found the files but... never tried to release them.

**SAMANTHA**
 No, instead you started dreaming about revenge.

**SAMANTHA**
 But dreams cost money. So you waited.

**SAMANTHA**
 You tracked down more survivors of Oxcart. All of them troubled but talented.

**SAMANTHA**
 You promised to bring them justice and strung them along with just enough of the real files.

**SAMANTHA**
 And with their combined skills, you turned your boutique InfoSec firm into a billion dollar operation.

**SAMANTHA**
 At which point... you had more than what you needed to get your revenge.

**SAMANTHA**
 The only problem was... Alan Dubeck.

**SAMANTHA**
 You accidentally gave him something he never had. A real community.

**SAMANTHA**
 And all of a sudden he wasn't quite so interested in bloody revenge.

**SAMANTHA**
 He tried to back out of the plan, didn't he?

**SAMANTHA**
 So you had to get rid of him.

**SAMANTHA**
 Considering Gannon controlled all the medicine coming into The Hive, it wouldn't be so hard to swap his pills.

**SAMANTHA**
 Instead of giving him something that slowed down his brain, you sped it up.

**SAMANTHA**
 Exacerbating the side effects and making it look, to everybody else, like he was losing it.

**SAMANTHA**
 With him out of the way... you had Gannon. The one team member who already had a death sentence to take his place.

**SAMANTHA**
 And then, the stage was set... for your fucked up idea of justice.

**SAMANTHA**
 Blowing up schools across DC to make as many people feel the same pain as you?

**ELI COOPER**
 Woo! Bravo! Bravo, bravo, bravo, bravo, bravo!

**ELI COOPER**
 Now I'm really glad you're here.

**ELI COOPER**
 You know, you put so much work into something, it's so great to have somebody recognize it.

**SAMANTHA**
 It won't just be families of politicians or CIA officers. You'll be killing thousands of innocent people.

**ELI COOPER**
 Correct. I mean, if you want to make an omelet, you know, you gotta blow up some schools, right?

**SAMANTHA**
 It's not what Gus would have wanted.

**ELI COOPER**
 Oh, Gus! Who... who gives a fuck? Who?

**ELI COOPER**
 My son's dead and it's what I want!

**ELI COOPER**
 Fantasizing over and over and over about this day is the only thing that's kept me going all these years!

**SAMANTHA**
 You're fucking crazy.

**ELI COOPER**
 Oh, well. Be that as it may... I know something you don't know.

**SAMANTHA**
 What?

**ELI COOPER**
 You ready?

**ELI COOPER**
 Project Oxcart didn't shut down.

**ELI COOPER**
 They went the way of Aunt Jemima. Changed the name, but kept the same sweet recipe.

**SAMANTHA**
 You're lying.

**ELI COOPER**
 Well you don't have to take my word for it. Especially when I've got the audio logs right here.

**SAMANTHA**
 Audio logs?

**ELI COOPER**
 Oh, you know spies always recording. Here, take a listen. We got a couple minutes to kill, right?

**LUMINARY**
 Okay. Bring in the next subject.

**LUMINARY**
 Good morning, Tetra. Welcome to your fourth lesson. There is a box on the table in front of you. All you need to do is open it.

**LUMINARY 2**
 Watch out! Watch out, she's got a knife!

**LUMINARY 3**
 Where did you get that from?

**YOUNG SAM (TETRA)**
 There. It's open.

**SAMANTHA**
 That's... that's me.

**ELI COOPER**
 Shh-shh-shh. Don't talk over it. You're gonna love this next part.

**THE ASCENDANT**
 That's good work, Tetra. Finally, someone uses the knife.

**YOUNG SAM (TETRA)**
 You knew I had a knife?

**THE ASCENDANT**
 Of course. We're on the same team, after all.

**ELI COOPER**
 She doesn't sound quite so sweet without the voice scrambler, does she?

**SAMANTHA**
 Is that...

**ELI COOPER**
 No no no no. Hold on. Hold on. I got some more recent ones too.

I need to know why you broke into your school's network. It's a very serious violation.

Were you... trying to steal something?

**YOUNG SAM**
 No. I just wanted to lower the sound of the school bells. They're too loud. Am I in trouble?

No, you're not in trouble. I'm not a police officer. I'm actually with the CIA. And I have been looking a long time for a talent like yours.

What's your name?

**YOUNG SAM**
 Samantha Sloane. Sam.

Well, it's very nice to meet you, Sam. My name is **MICHELLE**.

**ELI COOPER**
 Stay with me, Sam. We're short on time, okay? I'm just gonna jump ahead to the last one.

**MICHELLE**
 I've got some favors I can cash in myself. Someone at the DO who owes me a job to you. Just don't make me look bad.

**MICHELLE**
 At my age, legacy's all I've got.

**YOUNG SAM**
 I won't. Thanks, Michelle.

**MICHELLE**
 What do you need friends for anyway, when you got me? Huh?

**SAMANTHA**
 It can't be.

**ELI COOPER**
 You see... Project Oxcart, that's a thing of the past. Project Tetra on the other hand... Ah! That's alive and well.

**ELI COOPER**
 That's my five minute warning. Show's about to begin. All right, let me just grab our little live studio audience.

**SAMANTHA**
 How could Michelle be The Ascendant?

**ELI COOPER**
 Oh! Why don't you ask her yourself?

**SAMANTHA**
 Michelle!

**MICHELLE**
 Mmmph! Mm!

**SAMANTHA**
 That's why you needed me. You didn't want me to help with The Hive or to get you into the CIA.

**SAMANTHA**
 You wanted me to lure her out. That day in the park? The van I saw? It was all you.

**ELI COOPER**
 Damn. This one is... deceptively slippery to get a hold of.

**ELI COOPER**
 But like cracking a secure system, I just had to find the vulnerability.

**ELI COOPER**
 You.

**SAMANTHA**
 You went through... you went through all of this... just to bring her here to watch?

**ELI COOPER**
 Of course. It drove Gannon totally crazy but you know what? He has no sense of showmanship.

**ELI COOPER**
 After all, like you said, today will hurt a lot of people who had nothing to do with Oxcart.

**ELI COOPER**
 But, at least I'll know I got the big one.

**ELI COOPER**
 I'll know I took the person most responsible for Gus's death and made them... like me.

**ELI COOPER**
 Now, if you'll direct your attention to the main screen right there...

**SAMANTHA**
 Her granddaughter.

**TEACHER**
 Okay kids, everybody grab a laptop from the cart.

**ELI COOPER**
 Oh gosh, it is so great for teaching computer literacy so early nowadays, right?

**ELI COOPER**
 I mean that's when it's most effective. I think I read that somewhere once.

**SAMANTHA**
 Did you know I was there when Gus died?

**SAMANTHA**
 Yeah, I remember everything.

**SAMANTHA**
 Don't you want to know his last words?

**ELI COOPER**
 You know, Sam... instead of focusing on the negative all the time, you should try to take pleasure in these last moments.

**ELI COOPER**
 I mean, one could make the case that Michelle Anderson right here hurt you even worse than she did me.

**ELI COOPER**
 She made you into a weapon. She's the reason why you're broken.

**ELI COOPER**
 Why you're never gonna be normal. Why you'll always be alone.

**SAMANTHA**
 You're wrong, Eli.

**SAMANTHA**
 I'm not alone.

**SAMANTHA**
 Not anymore.

**GANNON**
 No, you are not.

**GANNON**
 Look who I found on one of our laptops.

**NIA**
 You get your fucking hands off me!

**ELI COOPER**
 Ah, so that's who you're stalling for.

**ELI COOPER**
 Did you think that because the laptops were connected to the same network that you could diffuse the bombs?

**ELI COOPER**
 That's why I hardwired the timers.

**ELI COOPER**
 There's nothing that's gonna stop those bombs from going off.

**SAMANTHA**
 Nia?

**NIA**
 He's telling the truth, Sam. I got into the laptops but there was no way to diffuse the bombs.

**NIA**
 But what do you do with a knot you can't untie?

**NIA**
 You say "fuck that knot" and you do your own shit.

**AUTOMATED VOICE**
 Evacuate now. This laptop is a bomb.

**AUTOMATED VOICE**
 Evacuate now. This laptop is a bomb.

**ELI COOPER**
 What is happening? What is that?

**AUTOMATED VOICE**
 Evacuate now. This laptop is a bomb.

**SAMANTHA**
 Your alarm program. Nia rewrote it.

**NIA**
 Yeah, you remember the Squealer? Don't you, Eli?

**AUTOMATED VOICE**
 Evacuate now. This laptop is a bomb.

**ELI COOPER**
 What the... No. No! Wait! No! No! Where are they going?

**AUTOMATED VOICE**
 Evacuate now. This laptop is a bomb.

**ELI COOPER**
 God! Kill them! Kill them both! Come on now!

**AUTOMATED VOICE**
 Evacuate now. This laptop is a bomb.

**AUTOMATED VOICE**
 Evacuate now. This laptop is a bomb.

**AUTOMATED VOICE**
 Evacuate now. This laptop is a bomb.

**BROOKS ALDER**
 That's why you always double tap.

**AUTOMATED VOICE**
 Evacuate now. This laptop is a bomb.

**ELI COOPER**
 No!

**SAMANTHA**
 Brooks!

**BROOKS ALDER**
 Eli Cooper! Step back from that computer! Put your hands up! Or I'll shoot you too!

**AUTOMATED VOICE**
 Evacuate now. This laptop is a bomb.

**AUTOMATED VOICE**
 Evacuate now. This laptop is a bomb.

**NIA**
 I guess Brooks had what it takes after all.

**ELI COOPER**
 No! No! This is not how it's supposed to go!

**BROOKS ALDER**
 Nia, help her out of her cuffs. Shut that screen off.

**SAMANTHA**
 I can still hear the alarm. Where is that coming from?

**NIA**
 The laptop in the lobby.

**NIA**
 They must be all over. He's got this whole place rigged to blow.

**ELI COOPER**
 Oh. Did I forget to mention that?

**ELI COOPER**
 I mean if I can't share my vengeance with you... at least I can share a tomb.

**BROOKS ALDER**
 Let's get out of here.

**SAMANTHA**
 Old time's sake, Michelle.

**MICHELLE**
 Sam!

**SAMANTHA**
 First, we make it out of here. And you and I are gonna talk.

**BROOKS ALDER**
 You too, Eli. Move it.

**ELI COOPER**
 Oh, or what? You're gonna shoot me?

**ELI COOPER**
 Nope. No, you will not take this one from me.

**NIA**
 Yeah, fuck him. We don't have time. Let's go!

**BROOKS ALDER**
 Come on! Entrance is this way!

**SAMANTHA**
 Wait! I... I know a faster way out!

**BROOKS ALDER**
 We don't have time to get lost! We should retrace our steps!

**SAMANTHA**
 There's a back entrance! It's where they used to take smoke breaks. It's faster!

**BROOKS ALDER**
 Okay. Lead the way.

**SAMANTHA**
 Through these double doors!

**NIA**
 Fuck. It's locked.

**SAMANTHA**
 There's a latch up top!

**BROOKS ALDER**
 Keep going! We need to get further—

**SAMANTHA**
 Are you guys okay?

**MICHELLE**
 Oh... I'll live.

**NIA**
 I am so done with getting blown up.

**PARAMEDIC**
 Sir, you've been shot. We need to get you onto the ambulance.

**BROOKS ALDER**
 No, not yet.

**OFFICER**
 Alder. I got him on the line.

**BROOKS ALDER**
 Thank you.

**BROOKS ALDER**
 Hey buddy. Hey, how's it going? I know, I know. I know, it must have been scary.

**BROOKS ALDER**
 I'm sorry I wasn't there. Heh. No. Uh, I don't think there will be school tomorrow.

**SAMANTHA**
 So what's the latest from the scene?

**BROOKS ALDER**
 It's chaos. Word from the Bureau is twelve schools got hit. Most of them totally leveled.

**SAMANTHA**
 Casualties?

**BROOKS ALDER**
 Well, it's early and I don't want to jinx anything, but... with three minutes warning, it seems like everybody had time to evacuate.

**SAMANTHA**
 Good. That's... that's good.

**BROOKS ALDER**
 You really think this Anderson woman is somehow responsible for all this? She certainly doesn't look dangerous.

**SAMANTHA**
 No. She doesn't.

**SAMANTHA**
 Can I have a moment alone with her?

**MICHELLE**
 Hello, Sam.

**SAMANTHA**
 15 years.

**SAMANTHA**
 For 15 years, you were the only person I trusted.

**SAMANTHA**
 I thought you cared about me. I thought you were my friend, but... it was all manipulation.

**SAMANTHA**
 You were pulling the strings on my life every step of the way. Keeping me isolated from anyone outside of your control.

**MICHELLE**
 What do you want, a fucking apology? I'm not your mommy.

**MICHELLE**
 You were my asset. That's what we do here. You know that.

**SAMANTHA**
 Not to children.

**MICHELLE**
 Oh, that was always your only weakness, Sam. Your naivety.

**MICHELLE**
 I was younger than you when I served in Vietnam. I was a nurse.

**MICHELLE**
 My first week in the country, we lost an entire infantry squad to a VC suicide bomber who witnesses said was no more than eight or nine years old.

**MICHELLE**
 At the time I was shocked. But looking back on it I saw it for what it really was. Dedication.

**MICHELLE**
 The kind it takes to win a war.

**MICHELLE**
 You know what I was doing at the CIA when I proposed Project Oxcart? Predictive modeling.

**MICHELLE**
 A war is coming, Sam. One that requires a new kind of soldier.

**MICHELLE**
 Do you want to know what I've spent the last 25 years training you for?

**SAMANTHA**
 No. It doesn't matter. I quit.

**MICHELLE**
 Do you think you're special? Do you think you're the only one?

**NEWS ANCHOR**
 Mr. Alder. Thank you for joining us. How has your recovery been?

**BROOKS ALDER**
 It's been good, Chairman. Thank you for asking.

**NEWS ANCHOR**
 Good. It's now been three months since the attacks orchestrated by Eli Cooper destroyed a dozen schools and caused hundreds of millions of dollars in property damage across our nation's capital.

**NEWS ANCHOR**
 One of the most discussed aspects of the incident has been the link between Eli Cooper and a recently leaked CIA program known as Project Oxcart.

**NEWS ANCHOR**
 What can you tell us about this connection?

**BROOKS ALDER**
 I can't comment directly on that, but we are continuing to gather information on all potential connections to the case.

**NEWS ANCHOR**
 From what I understand there were two individuals who had a connection both to Eli Cooper and also the fire that took place at Langley just before the attacks.

**NEWS ANCHOR**
 Do you have any information as to who these individuals are or where they might be located?

**BROOKS ALDER**
 I can't comment directly on that, but we are continuing to gather information.

**NIA**
 Did you know you were gonna be on TV when you chose that tie?

**BROOKS ALDER**
 My son chose it actually.

**NIA**
 Yeah, I was gonna say it looks so much better than what you usually wear.

**SAMANTHA**
 Dinner is served.

**SAMANTHA**
 Oh, you don't have to blow on it. After cooking I dropped the temperature down to an optimal 125 degrees Fahrenheit for serving.

**NIA**
 Hmm, thanks Sam.

**SAMANTHA**
 I apologize for the mismatched bowls. I have never hosted friends for dinner before.

**BROOKS ALDER**
 You told me about this soup. This is what you make before a hack, right? Sumo stew?

**SAMANTHA**
 Chanko Nabe. Made with love.

**BROOKS ALDER**
 Input determines output.

**SAMANTHA**
 Although there is no scientific evidence that the emotional state with which a meal is prepared has any impact on flavor.

**NIA**
 This soup is good. Don't ruin it by getting all sappy.

**BROOKS ALDER**
 Sorry.

**NEWS ANCHOR**
 It has been reported that Eli Cooper died on site at a former CIA facility in West Virginia, that was also destroyed in the blasts.

**NEWS ANCHOR**
 But, from what we understand they haven't yet found any evidence of his remains in the rubble.

**NEWS ANCHOR**
 Is that correct?

**BROOKS ALDER**
 I can't comment directly on that, but...

**SAMANTHA**
 That's enough of that.

**SAMANTHA**
 It's time to move on.

**BROOKS ALDER**
 Wait. Why did you make Chanko Nabe soup today?

**BROOKS ALDER**
 You two are working on something new, aren't you? What is it?

**NIA**
 Well, it definitely doesn't have to do with fucking explosives.

**NIA**
 I'll tell you that much.

**BROOKS ALDER**
 Uh-huh. And I assume this will all be within the bounds of the law?

**SAMANTHA**
 We can't comment directly on that.

**BROOKS ALDER**
 That's not funny.
