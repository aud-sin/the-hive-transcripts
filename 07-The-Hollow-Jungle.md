# Episode 7 - The Hollow Jungle
---
**BEETLE**
 Why are they still following us?

**YOUNG SAM (TETRA)**
 Shh! Let's listen.

**YOUNG SAM (TETRA)**
 We have to keep going.

**LUMINARY**
 There they are!

**YOUNG SAM (TETRA)**
 Come on, Beetle! Faster!

**YOUNG SAM (TETRA)**
 Train up ahead! We gotta get across the tracks before it comes!

**BEETLE**
 We're not gonna make it!

**YOUNG SAM (TETRA)**
 Yes we will! Run!

**BEETLE**
 I can't!

**YOUNG SAM (TETRA)**
 Beetle! Beetle!

**YOUNG SAM (TETRA)**
 Beetle! Are you okay?

**BEETLE**
 That was too close. It’ll buy us some time, but... we have to keep moving.

**BEETLE**
 Come on, Tetra. It's snowing and... and dark and we haven't seen anyone for hours. We gotta rest.

**YOUNG SAM (TETRA)**
 We can't. What if they find us while we're sleeping?

**BEETLE**
 What about this tree? We... we can climb up it and even if they come by they won't find us up there.

**YOUNG SAM (TETRA)**
 Okay. Yeah. Let's rest.

**BROOKS ALDER**
 Go for Alder.

**BROOKS ALDER**
 Hello? Who is this?

**ELI COOPER**
 Hello, Brooks Alder. This is Eli Cooper. I heard through the grapevine that you were uh... looking for me. So I... I just thought I'd give you a ring.

**BROOKS ALDER**
 Where are you?

**ELI COOPER**
 Oh, I'm on a beach in Cartagena... I'm at my office downtown... I'm in the ATM security camera across the street from your car. In our interconnected society, I mean... where can't one be?

**SAMANTHA**
 Hang up the phone, Brooks. You won't get anything from him, he's fishing for information.

**ELI COOPER**
 Oh, hello Sam! Ah, I was so bummed you got caught before making it back to The Hive. You missed the surprise party! We had a real blast, didn't we Nia?

**NIA**
 Oh yeah. It's always a fun time with the world's greatest dad.

**BROOKS ALDER**
 Listen. You've made your point. You've got the world's attention. Why don't you just come in? We've got the proof. We can expose the full truth of what happened.

**ELI COOPER**
 Ah, that's a pretty enticing offer. Do you want to hear a better one? Twenty million dollars laundered through untraceable crypto accounts directly into your bank.

**ELI COOPER**
 All you have to do is shoot those two violent criminals you have in your custody. They've hurt innocent people. You'd be a hero. A hero whose family is financially set for life. I mean, when's the last time a government employee said that?

**ELI COOPER**
 Sounds like a win-win-win to me. Oh, and Brooks? I would recommend rejecting this... I mean at least out loud.

**BROOKS ALDER**
 I've made note of your offer. It'll be on the list of charges when I bring you in.

**ELI COOPER**
 Yeah, perfect. Exactly like that. Offer's on the table until 9:00 AM when it expires. Along with some other things. Think it over. Toodles.

**SAMANTHA**
 Wait, Eli?

**ELI COOPER**
 Yes?

**SAMANTHA**
 I'll see you soon.

**BROOKS ALDER**
 He was watching us this whole time. How did he get my number?

**NIA**
 He does shit like that.

**SAMANTHA**
 Did you guys hear that?

**BROOKS ALDER**
 Hear what?

**SAMANTHA**
 Brooks, give me your phone. I want to pull up the video of Eli calling the news.

**BROOKS ALDER**
 Sure.

**SAMANTHA**
 So, I thought I might have heard something before but I wasn't sure until I heard it again when he called.

**ELI COOPER**
 [From phone video] I'm here today to declare war on the Central Intelligence Agency and by extension, the entire United States Government.

**ADAM**
 [From phone video] Um... uh... I'm... I'm having trouble underst—

**NIA**
 Wait, what are we supposed to be hearing?

**SAMANTHA**
 I'll play it again. Brooks, turn it up loud.

**ELI COOPER**
 [From phone video] ...and by extension, the entire United States Government.

**ADAM**
 [From phone video] Um...

**BROOKS ALDER**
 Is that a monkey? You think he what... fled to South America?

**SAMANTHA**
 It's a recording.

**NIA**
 Holy shit.

**SAMANTHA**
 I remember it.

**NIA**
 You think he's at The Hollow Jungle?

**SAMANTHA**
 I'm sure of it.

**BROOKS ALDER**
 Well, if we have the files, then we have the location, right?

**SAMANTHA**
 I'm already looking. It's redacted on every page. All I can gather is that the experiment was held at a CIA-owned facility.

**NIA**
 Redacted? You're telling me that the top secret CIA files which we had to steal from not one, but two highly secured facilities... they don't even have all the information we need?

**BROOKS ALDER**
 Yep. That's the CIA for you. When you make a living stealing secrets, you always assume someone will steal yours. It's still a lead though. I'll reach out to a friend at Archives. I can get a list of facilities that were active during the time and meet the criteria.

**NIA**
 Aren't there gonna be like... hundreds of locations? We only have eight hours left. There's no way we can go through every option.

**SAMANTHA**
 I think I know how to narrow it down. Nia, when you got out of The Hive, where did the others go?

**BROOKS ALDER**
 So this guy is another hacker, right? What can he do that you two can't?

**SAMANTHA**
 Play a video game.

**BROOKS ALDER**
 A video game?

**DYLAN**
 Sam! Nia! I couldn't... couldn't believe it when I saw you in my Twitch DMs. Who's this? Who's this?

**BROOKS ALDER**
 Brooks Alder. From the CIA Office of Inspector General.

**NIA**
 He's our captor. If you didn't notice our new jewelry.

**DYLAN**
 Oh. Um...

**SAMANTHA**
 We can trust him, Dylan. We don't have time for anything else.

**DYLAN**
 Right, right, right. Come in. We can use my mom's computer. Won't be as fast as what I had in The Hive but... should get the job done.

**NIA**
 Is this her place?

**DYLAN**
 Yep, yep, yep. I bought it for her with the money I made in Marathon. Sit, sit. Sorry about the mess. Just when she finally beats her pill addiction she's diagnosed with Lymphoma and gets put right back on 'em. Life's funny, huh? So you really... you really got the Project Oxcart files?

**NIA**
 We sure fucking did. We'll give you the Spark Notes. You ever hear of something called "Moonlight Maze"?

**DYLAN**
 Yeah. Massive cyber intrusion in the 90s. Somebody was stealing files from the U.S. government for years before they had any idea.

**NIA**
 They stole enough classified paperwork to build a log cabin around the Lincoln Memorial. Naturally, that made the Washington brass just about shit themselves. They realized how unprepared they were for the future of cyber warfare.

**NIA**
 So, they took Uncle Sam's credit card, started green-lighting every related project proposal that came across their desk. No matter how "out there." Project Oxcart was one of 'em.

**SAMANTHA**
 Oxcart's stated mission was to use cutting edge technology and bio-hacking tools—chemical injections, gene editing, tDCS, radiation-induced neurogenesis—to rewire and strengthen neural pathways in the human brain.

**SAMANTHA**
 They were trying to build the perfect cyber warrior who would not only have the technical skills but also the creativity needed to break into any system.

**NIA**
 And... we were their lab rats. You know they even had an estimate for the number of subjects they expected to develop cancer by 40? It's a lot, by the way. So, you know... we all got that to look forward to.

**DYLAN**
 Did it say... say who was responsible?

**NIA**
 There are other names in the files but the person in charge is only ever referred to as "The Ascendant."

**SAMANTHA**
 But that in itself tells us a lot. Whoever The Ascendant was, his name must have carried power at the Agency. And given that he was able to fast-track a project this brazen... If I had to, I'd guess he was senior leadership.

**DYLAN**
 Did it say why the project ended?

**SAMANTHA**
 I always assumed it was shut down but the files paint it as a success. It lasted for the duration of its outlined scope and then... overnight it just stopped. I guess they learned all they could from us and they threw us back in the hospitals and disappeared.

**BROOKS ALDER**
 But the pressing matter at hand is finding the location this all took place. This "Hollow Jungle". It's redacted from the files but Sam thought you might be able to help.

**DYLAN**
 Me?

**SAMANTHA**
 You know the game you showed me? Finding locations based on clues? I just sent you a list of all the CIA owned facilities that match the time period and criteria.

**DYLAN**
 There are almost 500 locations on here.

**SAMANTHA**
 And one of them is The Hollow Jungle. But we need to narrow down the list.

**BROOKS ALDER**
 You almost remember some details that could help identify the location.

**DYLAN**
 It's hard... hard to say. Between whatever they were giving us and... the things they were doing to us...

**NIA**
 It's hard to trust any memories from that place.

**DYLAN**
 Yeah.

**NIA**
 Well we know from the files that when transporting us in and out of the facility, they drugged us with chloral hydrate administered via ginger root tea to keep the location hidden. Chloral hydrate has an effective duration of up to 12 hours. So if we look at this list of hospitals where subjects were potentially pulled from...

**DYLAN**
 Yep, yep, yep. Way ahead of you. Okay. Here's the list narrowed down to only the facilities within 12 hours driving time of every feeder hospital. This is assuming... assuming the routes haven't changed too drastically in the last 25 years.

**BROOKS ALDER**
 194 properties. Still too many.

**NIA**
 And based on the correspondence records between DC and the operative's own location, we know they're in the same time zone.

**DYLAN**
 Limiting it to Eastern Time Zone gets us to... 168.

**BROOKS ALDER**
 Well, we got it down a bit. Maybe we head back to my office and start pulling files on each of these.

**SAMANTHA**
 Wait. I have more clues. I went outside the facility once.

**NIA**
 You did?

**SAMANTHA**
 I was in the woods. And there was a... there was a train track nearby. No more than 20 minutes by foot.

**DYLAN**
 What... what... what kind of train? Passenger?

**SAMANTHA**
 Cargo, I think. It was a long one.

**DYLAN**
 Okay. I'm eliminating... eliminating all the locations that are not in wooded areas or are further than three miles from a cargo train route.

**NIA**
 34! That's progress.

**DYLAN**
 What else you got, Sam?

**SAMANTHA**
 At night, there were owls calling out to each other.

**DYLAN**
 Mm. What time of year do you think this was? Summer? Winter?

**SAMANTHA**
 Files say the program shut down in July but it... it must have been about three months earlier. No more than four, but it was snowing that night.

**DYLAN**
 Owl calls. Did they sound like this?

**SAMANTHA**
 No. It sounded more like a... like a truck backing up. You know, kind of... toot-toot-toot.

**DYLAN**
 Mm. What about... what about this?

**SAMANTHA**
 Yeah, that's it!

**DYLAN**
 That's a Northern Saw-whet Owl. That's their mating call. You hear it a lot at that time of year. You can technically find them all over but they have semi-isolated populations along the Appalachian Mountains in Tennessee and West- West Virginia. Which narrows us down to...

**BROOKS ALDER**
 12 locations. 12 locations!

**SAMANTHA**
 Yes! Yeah, that's it!

**DYLAN**
 But, but, but, but, but! In the year 2000 there was no snowfall in that region of Tennessee after March. So that leaves just this zone in West Virginia. And that? That's why I'm the champ.

**NIA**
 Four locations! Let's fucking go!

**DYLAN**
 Shoot. It's my mom's... onc... oncologist. I gotta take this. But you guys can keep messing around with it.

**BROOKS ALDER**
 Nice work, Dylan. Thanks for your help.

**NIA**
 Yeah. I'll look up the four remaining addresses, see if there's any juicy OSINT on 'em.

**BROOKS ALDER**
 And I'll run it by my people.

**SAMANTHA**
 You two get started on that and um... I'm going to check on Dylan really quickly.

**DYLAN**
 Okay. I'll tell her. Thank you.

**DYLAN**
 Did you need something, Sam?

**SAMANTHA**
 No, no, I just um... wanted to check. Is everything okay with your mom?

**DYLAN**
 Oh, yeah. Just an update from our oncology specialist.

**SAMANTHA**
 Must be a dedicated specialist for them to call in the middle of the night.

**DYLAN**
 He's in Germany. The Cancer Research Center in Heidelberg. It's world... world-class. I told him I'd be awake when the X-Ray results came in. I'd just be up worrying about them anyways.

**SAMANTHA**
 That makes sense. So um... how were the results?

**DYLAN**
 Do you think... do you think I'm lying to you, Sam?

**SAMANTHA**
 Oh, no, I... I didn't say that. I just... think it's a bit odd that a world-class doctor would order X-Rays for a blood-based cancer.

**DYLAN**
 Did I say X-Ray? I meant... meant MRI.

**SAMANTHA**
 What are you doing with that knife?

**DYLAN**
 I don't know. Don't know.

**SAMANTHA**
 That was Eli, wasn't it? He offered you money for your mom's treatment. He said it was us or her, didn't he?

**SAMANTHA**
 Look, I... I know you see him as a father figure but you can't trust him. He's trying to exploit a weak point.

**DYLAN**
 He said you'd say that.

**SAMANTHA**
 Listen to me, Dylan. We're gonna stop him.

**DYLAN**
 You... can... not... not... Not... not... Not. Not.

**SAMANTHA**
 Dylan, just put the knife down.

**SAMANTHA**
 Dylan, you aren't trained for a fight but I am! I... I don't want to hurt you!

**DYLAN**
 Not! Not! Not!

**SAMANTHA**
 Dylan, I won't warn you again!

**BROOKS ALDER**
 Sam! Sam!

**SAMANTHA**
 Jesus Christ...

**BROOKS ALDER**
 What happened?

**SAMANTHA**
 Eli.

**NIA**
 Oh shit... he got to Dylan. He knows we're here.

**DYLAN'S MOM**
 Dylan? Dylan, is that you?

**NIA**
 His mom's awake. Fuck. We need to be gone.

**DYLAN'S MOM**
 Dylan?

**BROOKS ALDER**
 Wow, what a mess. What have I got myself into?

**NIA**
 Guys, we need to go. Now!

**DYLAN'S MOM**
 What's going on?

**SAMANTHA**
 I'm sorry, Dylan...

**NIA**
 Guys, let's go!

**BROOKS ALDER**
 How does he keep finding us?

**NIA**
 Oh shit. I think I know how.

**BROOKS ALDER**
 What was that?

**NIA**
 My phone. It's the same one I had in The Hive. Eli could have planted a tracker on it.

**NIA**
 I don't know what else he might have access to but we should just get rid of everything.

**BROOKS ALDER**
 That's a pretty convenient thing for you to forget.

**NIA**
 Well what the fuck is that supposed to mean?

**BROOKS ALDER**
 You know what it means. You worked with Eli for a long time before Sam ever arrived. How can we be sure where your loyalties lie?

**NIA**
 Well they sure as hell don't lie with the person who tried to blow my ass up. You're the one we can't trust!

**YOUNG SAM (TETRA)**
 Trust me. I'll keep us safe.

**NIA**
 Maybe you tipped off Dylan to split the reward money.

**BROOKS ALDER**
 That is ridiculous! I am an officer of the law!

**YOUNG SAM**
 No, you're an officer of the CIA. Which, you know, come to think of it, has very good reason to tie up loose ends like us.

**SAMANTHA**
 Tie the knot you cannot tie. Tie the knot you cannot tie. Tie the knot you cannot tie. Tie the knot you cannot tie. Tie the knot you cannot tie. Tie the knot you cannot tie.

**NIA**
 Sam?

**BROOKS ALDER**
 What's going on back there?

**NIA**
 Shit! Pull over! Pull over!

**BEETLE**
 Careful... some of these branches are pretty icy.

**YOUNG SAM (TETRA)**
 Wow, Beetle. You're really good at climbing trees.

**BEETLE**
 I used to climb these at home all the time.

**BEETLE**
 And... you can stop calling me Beetle. My name is Gus. Gus Cooper.

**YOUNG SAM (TETRA)**
 Gus Cooper. I'm Samantha Sloane. Sam.

**YOUNG SAM (TETRA)**
 Did you hear that?

**YOUNG GUS (BEETLE)**
 Just an owl.

**YOUNG SAM (TETRA)**
 I don't think I'll be able to fall asleep.

**YOUNG GUS (BEETLE)**
 Back home... whenever I couldn't fall asleep... my dad used to sing me this song.

**YOUNG GUS (BEETLE)**
 Will you walk a little faster? Said a whiting to a snail.

**YOUNG GUS (BEETLE)**
 There's a porpoise close behind us. And he's treading on my tail.

**YOUNG GUS (BEETLE)**
 See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance.

**YOUNG GUS (BEETLE)**
 They are waiting on the shingle. Will you come and join the dance? Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the dance?

**LUMINARY**
 Peek-a-boo! We've got you surrounded.

**LUMINARY**
 You gave us quite a chase, but it's over now. So why don't you two climb down off that tree, huh?

**YOUNG GUS (BEETLE)**
 We're not going back there!

**LUMINARY 2**
 You can come down on your own or you can be dragged down!

**YOUNG SAM (TETRA)**
 Okay, okay! We're coming down.

**YOUNG GUS (BEETLE)**
 What are you doing?

**YOUNG SAM (TETRA)**
 We don't have a choice, Gus. I'm sorry.

**LUMINARY**
 That's right. That's right. You got her?

**LUMINARY 2**
 I got her!

**LUMINARY**
 All right, kid. Your turn.

**YOUNG GUS (BEETLE)**
 Not coming down!

**LUMINARY**
 Ah, you fucking brat!

**YOUNG SAM (TETRA)**
 Gus, just come down!

**YOUNG GUS (BEETLE)**
 No!

**LUMINARY**
 Here we go. I gotcha. Come-

**YOUNG GUS (BEETLE)**
 Get off of me! I'm not going back there! I'm not going back there! I'm not going- Aahhhhh!

**LUMINARY**
 Dammit. Oh fuck.

**YOUNG SAM (TETRA)**
 Gus!

**LUMINARY**
 Oh fuck.

**LUMINARY 2**
 What did you do?

**LUMINARY**
 I... I... I told them to come down from there. You see what you did, you little brat? This is what happens when you run away! This is all your fault!

**YOUNG SAM (TETRA)**
 Gus? Wake up! Gus what are you doing? Do something! Do something!

**BROOKS ALDER**
 Sam? Sam? Are you okay?

**SAMANTHA**
 Um... yeah. What happened?

**NIA**
 You blacked out again.

**BROOKS ALDER**
 Here. For your nose.

**NIA**
 You good?

**SAMANTHA**
 Look, there's something you guys need to know. Something I haven't told you. This whole thing... I think it might be... I think it might all be my fault.

**BROOKS ALDER**
 What are you talking about?

**SAMANTHA**
 I knew Eli's son. Back in the Hollow Jungle. They called him Beetle.

**NIA**
 Beetle?

**SAMANTHA**
 We tried to run away. He... didn't want to. But I told him that I'd protect him. But... I messed up. And we got caught.

**SAMANTHA**
 And he got killed because of me. If it wasn't for me, Eli, the Hive, Alan Dubeck, none of it would have happened. And the more I try and fix it, the more people I convince to trust me, the... the more blood I end up with on my hands.

**BROOKS ALDER**
 Sam... you can't possibly blame yourself for all of this. Look, you were a... just a kid trying to escape a messed up situation. None of this is your fault.

**NIA**
 Jesus, Sam. Is that what you've been holding onto this whole time? No wonder you keep getting these blackouts.

**SAMANTHA**
 What do you mean?

**NIA**
 You saw the files. Everything they did to us. It was designed to enhance the neural connections in our brain, right? So the trauma you suffered would be overwhelming for a normal person. But for you? I mean, I'm sure whenever you're reminded of it, it feels like you're right back there.

**SAMANTHA**
 Yeah.

**BROOKS ALDER**
 You know Sam, everything in my training, everything in your file... it all tells me I should take you at your word. And not trust you. Let me see your cuffs.

**SAMANTHA**
 What are you doing?

**BROOKS ALDER**
 Probably getting myself fired. Look, I don't know if we can all trust each other. But I know if we don't, we're definitely gonna fail.

**BROOKS ALDER**
 Nia, let me cut yours off too.

**NIA**
 As if. What, I'll lose mine at Dylan's house.

**BROOKS ALDER**
 Oh. Well. Okay then.

**SAMANTHA**
 So we have four locations we need to check out by 9:00 AM.

**NIA**
 Mm-mm. Three. One of 'em's a Costco now.

**BROOKS ALDER**
 We can hit all of them. But we have to move fast.

**SAMANTHA**
 And Nia's right. We should get rid of anything that connects us to the internet. It's the only way to make sure he won't see us coming.

**BROOKS ALDER**
 Fine. I'm the only one still with a phone, right? No offense. But aren't you two going to be kind of limited without a connection?

**NIA**
 Fuck it. We'll do it analog.

**RADIO DJ**
 Good morning West Virginia, it's 8:40 AM on a beautiful day in the Mountain State. Sunny skies, comfortable 68 degrees... A perfect day to get outside and enjoy some of that...

**BROOKS ALDER**
 All right. Moment of truth. This is our last option.

**BROOKS ALDER**
 If it's not here...

**NIA**
 Then Sam and I take off into the bushes, try to make it out of the country.

**NIA**
 Just kidding, Brooks.

**BROOKS ALDER**
 The map says a facility should be just up this trail. Didn't want to park too close if he's here.

**BROOKS ALDER**
 Sam?

**SAMANTHA**
 This is it.

**BROOKS ALDER**
 How do you know?

**SAMANTHA**
 Look up.

**BROOKS ALDER**
 A... palm tree? In the middle of the forest?

**SAMANTHA**
 Not a real one.

**BROOKS ALDER**
 The Hollow Jungle.

**NIA**
 Our interest is over here.

**BROOKS ALDER**
 "Rainforest Resort and Lodge."

**NIA**
 It's a fucking themed hotel.

**SAMANTHA**
 I always thought the jungle sounds were just to confuse us.

**BROOKS ALDER**
 Well, from the looks of the sod, this place has probably been abandoned since the 70s.

**NIA**
 Okay, so are we gonna stand around admiring the history of this place or go shoot this motherfucker?

**BROOKS ALDER**
 Stay behind me.

**NIA**
 Wow.

**BROOKS ALDER**
 I believe this place exists.

**NIA**
 The wallpaper...

**NIA**
 It's just like in my nightmares. If you stare at it long enough you can see the jaguars hiding in the trees.

**BROOKS ALDER**
 Sam? You okay?

**SAMANTHA**
 Um... Yeah. It's... it's all the same.

**NIA**
 Whoa. That's probably new.

**BROOKS ALDER**
 Is that one of the laptops?

**SAMANTHA**
 A Novabook. Just like at Dubeck's house in Gannon's room.

**NIA**
 Eli's here.

**BROOKS ALDER**
 Jesus. You'd never suspect it. It looks just like my son's.

**SAMANTHA**
 Hold on. Your son's... what?

**BROOKS ALDER**
 You know, his school laptop. They assign one to each student for the semester.

**SAMANTHA**
 Oh fuck.

**NIA**
 What is it, Sam?

**SAMANTHA**
 That day I went to Marathon to take the coding test? There was an information kiosk in the lobby. I watched this video about Eli Cooper and it talked about how generous he was.

**SAMANTHA**
 I dismissed it all as PR bullshit but... They said he donated 400,000 dollars worth of laptops to schools in the DC area.

**BROOKS ALDER**
 Oh my god.

**NIA**
 He's going after the fucking kids.
