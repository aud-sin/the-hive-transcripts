# Episode 5 - No Way Out
---
Beetle?

**BEETLE**
 I can't do it. I have to get out of here. I can't do it!

**GIRLS**
 You're gonna get us in trouble. Shh!

**BEETLE**
 I can't take it! I'm gonna die! I'm gonna die!

**LUMINARY**
 Quiet now. Next time I come back, there's consequences for everyone.

**BEETLE**
 Please...

**YOUNG SAM (TETRA)**\NHey. Beetle. It's gonna be okay.\N**GIRL**\NYou're gonna get us all in trouble.

**BEETLE**
 It's never gonna be okay.

**YOUNG SAM (TETRA)**
 Just listen to me. I'm gonna get us out of here.

**BEETLE**
 There's no way out.

**YOUNG SAM (TETRA)**
 I've run away from plenty of places before. There's always a way out.

**BEETLE**
 They'll kill us.

**YOUNG SAM (TETRA)**
 I'll keep us safe.

**BEETLE**
 Whoa, where'd you get a knife?

**YOUNG SAM (TETRA)**
 Shh! I took it from the cafeteria when nobody was looking.

**YOUNG SAM (TETRA)**
 We're gonna get out of here. Okay?

**BEETLE**
 Okay.

**YOUNG SAM (TETRA)**
 There's always a way out.

**NIA**
 I think we're being fucked.

**SAMANTHA**
 What do you mean?

**NIA**
 I just went to get Eli. And the motherfucker is gone, Sam. Gannon too. Dylan says they left the facility hours ago. I can't get in contact with either of them.

**SAMANTHA**
 I thought the plan was to wait for the files so he could put them on the evening news and... you know turn up the volume to 11.

**NIA**
 Yeah, well I think Eli had a different plan. Fucking... I knew. I knew I never should have trusted him.

**SAMANTHA**
 Different plan? What else could he be after?

**NIA**
 I have no fucking idea. But unless you're itching for a tour of the US's enhanced interrogation facilities, I suggest you get moving.

**SAMANTHA**
 We can't have come all this way for nothing.

**NIA**
 Just just get back to The Hive, alright? We'll regroup. We'll figure something out.

**NIA**
 Sam?

**SAMANTHA**
 Can I trust you?

**NIA**
 What?

**SAMANTHA**
 Is this all a setup you're pulling with Eli? Am I the patsy?

**NIA**
 Sam.

**SAMANTHA**
 Can I trust you?

**NIA**
 That place didn't turn us into people who can be trusted.

**SAMANTHA**
 Okay. I'm going to install a remote access terminal into the government's network but not just to the archives...to everything. Should give you access to camera feeds, electronic locks, subcontractor networks...

**NIA**
 Wait wait... Why?

**SAMANTHA**
 Because I'm not giving up yet. I'm gonna get out of here. We're gonna find out what Eli's really up to and then we're gonna find those files. And to do all of that we just... we need this access.

**SAMANTHA**
 Did you get it?

**SAMANTHA**
 I knew it was a leap of faith. This could have been Nia's plan all along... once I gave her this kind of access to the government network she could seize control of it... lock me out of the system and wait for me to be arrested.

**SAMANTHA**
 Nia. Nia, are you there?

**NIA**
 I'm in. I can see everything. Let's get you out of there.

**SAMANTHA**
 There may still be enough chaos downstairs for me to walk out without drawing attention.

**NIA**
 Okay scouting ahead on the security cams...

**MARCOS**
 Sloane! Untie me right now.

**MARCOS**
 You're fucking dead! They'll fry you for this, Sloane!

**NIA**
 Okay okay Sam, look, it's not gonna be so simple. Firefighters are clearing the first floor but they got armed officers with them.

**MARCOS**
 Sloane! Sloane, Sloane, Sloane. Don't you fucking leave me here!

**SAMANTHA**
 They must suspect the fire was started intentionally.

**NIA**
 Oh yeah, and they're gonna want to know what you're still doing in the building.

**SAMANTHA**
 How much time do I have?

**NIA**
 30 seconds? They're all... they're coming up the stairs now.

**MARCOS**
 Can anyone hear me?! Is anyone else still up here?! Help!

**SAMANTHA**
 Maybe I'm still in the building because I stayed behind to help someone.

**NIA**
 Help whom?

**MARCOS**
 Someone help me!

**MARCOS**
 Sloane! Finally. You're getting some sense back in you. Now once you let me out of here...

**SAMANTHA**
 I'm sorry about this.

**MARCOS**
 Wait. What are you doing? No! No!

**NIA**
 Really? That cannot be good for that man's brain.

**NIA**
 Uh, five, five seconds.

**SAMANTHA**
 Yeah, I'm getting him up.

**SWAT OFFICER**
 Hey! Stop right there! What are you doing in here?

**SAMANTHA**
 I need help over here! I work with Marcos, they... they knocked him out!

**SWAT OFFICER**
 What? What did you see?

**SAMANTHA**
 At least two men... average height... dressed in all black with balaclavas... I think they were heading towards the mission centers.

**SWAT OFFICER**
 Shit. Okay. We'll need backup...

**SAMANTHA**
 Do... do you want me to stay here?

**SWAT OFFICER**
 No. Go regroup with your team outside. We'll debrief you after.

**NIA**
 Very heroic.

**SAMANTHA**
 Once I got out of the building, there was so much confusion that I was able to retrieve my car and get off the lot unnoticed.

**INTERROGATOR**
 Well, that sounds like a fun little data heist you had over at Langley.

**SAMANTHA**
 It was a disaster.

**INTERROGATOR**
 Right, yeah, because you didn't get the files you came to steal?

**INTERROGATOR**
 You're unbelievable. This whole time you've been playing up the innocent victim act and I almost started to believe that maybe you had some plausible explanation for the chaos that went down over there.

**SAMANTHA**
 I never said I was an innocent.

**INTERROGATOR**
 You know who is innocent? Inez Rivas. Who works in the Langley cafeteria. Always smiling. Always remembers everyone's order. Except now she's in the hospital recovering from smoke inhalation. And that's on you.

**SAMANTHA**
 I... I didn't realize...

**INTERROGATOR**
 You blew up an oven in the middle of a crowded building. What did you think was gonna happen? A Cuban immigrant with three children working for barely above minimum wage. Is that the big bad CIA you're trying to get revenge on?

**SAMANTHA**
 I was trained to break things. Sometimes collateral damage...

**INTERROGATOR**
 No. Stop. Stop right there. I can't hear another second of this 'I'm a weapon' nonsense.

**INTERROGATOR**
 Even if I were to overlook the total lack of evidence and believe what you've told me about your past... it wouldn't change anything. Everybody comes from somewhere. I know I wrestle with my past every day. But at some point, you need to stop making excuses and take responsibility for your own actions.

**INTERROGATOR**
 You know what they call a terrorist with a valid reason for hating America?

**INTERROGATOR**
 A terrorist.

**SAMANTHA**
 Nia? I'm back in my car on the way back to The Hive. I'll need a boat for the last stretch.

**NIA**
 All right I'll look into it. I figured out how to get into the DC traffic cams so I can follow you as you go now. Fuck you can have a lot of fun with this access.

**SAMANTHA**
 We're just using it to get me back to The Hive and figure out what the hell Eli is up to and then I'm cutting it off.

**NIA**
 I know, I know. I'm just saying.

**SAMANTHA**
 What if Eli didn't stick around to see if we'd find the files on Project Oxcart because he already knew they wouldn't be there?

**NIA**
 You said the files were taken offline because they'd previously been breached, right?

**SAMANTHA**
 Yeah, 10 years ago this October.

**NIA**
 Huh.

**SAMANTHA**
 What?

**NIA**
 That's not long after Eli first started working with Alan Dubeck. The Hive before it was The Hive.

**SAMANTHA**
 You think Dubeck could have been the one who got those files?

**NIA**
 I mean, why not? Isn't that the first thing they would have tried to do? Eli said they were never able to breach the CIA's servers.

**NIA**
 But what if he lied? I mean, what if Eli and Dubeck got those files 10 years ago? But whatever they found inside... I... Look I don't know. Changed their plans somehow.

**SAMANTHA**
 But if Eli already breached the CIA servers, then why did he bring me to The Hive? Why send me into Langley?

**NIA**
 I don't know, Sam. Fuck. What do we know?

**NIA**
 Did you just make a turn? Sam, where are you going?

**SAMANTHA**
 Here's what we do know. This all started with Alan Dubeck. Somehow he's the key to figuring this all out. I just haven't been able to see it yet.

**NIA**
 Where are you going?

**SAMANTHA**
 The place where he died.

**FOREMAN**
 That's thunder. Wrap it up, boys.

**SAMANTHA**
 I'm going to take a look around. I'll call you back in a minute. I just need to focus.

**FOREMAN**
 Hey! That means you too! Let's go, let's go! Hey, wrap it up! Got a storm coming in! That's it. Going home.

**SAMANTHA**
 Just four weeks ago, half this block was a crater. You'd barely know it now aside from the shrinking pile of black rubble... It looks like any other residential construction site. Everybody just rushing to hide the trauma of the place. To rebuild it to the HOA standard so that nobody passing by would ever know that anything out of the ordinary happened here. There's no space in society for scars.

**INTERROGATOR**
 Did you find anything?

**SAMANTHA**
 A question mark.

**INTERROGATOR**
 What is that? A metaphor?

**SAMANTHA**
 Oh, no. I found a question mark keycap. Like from a laptop. Investigators must have missed it.

**INTERROGATOR**
 The report said they found fragments of at least seven laptops in his house. Doesn't seem too remarkable that they missed a key.

**SAMANTHA**
 I know, but... there's something about that keycap that felt significant. I don't know if it's an effect on what they did to me but sometimes I feel as though my brain makes connections before my conscious mind can catch up. This... this was one of those moments.

**SAMANTHA**
 Yeah?

**NIA**
 Yeah. Sorry to interrupt you and your mind palace, but I think your boss woke up. There's an APB out for your capture. Fucking says here you're considered to be 'extremely dangerous'.

**SAMANTHA**
 How much do they know?

**NIA**
 They have your name. You're going to need a new car.

**SAMANTHA**
 You know the electric car company Volterra?

**NIA**
 Yeah they make those ugly box looking cars.

**SAMANTHA**
 Well... I have no opinion on the aesthetics but they subcontract with the government to make military vehicles. Which means with your access you should be able to connect over to their network.

**NIA**
 What are you thinking?

**SAMANTHA**
 One of their cars is parked up the block. Virginia license plate 61 Alpha 53 X-ray.

**NIA**
 Give me a second.

**NIA**
 Yeah, chariot awaits, bitch.

**AUTOMATED VOICE**
 The number you are trying to dial is not in service. Please hang up and try—

**SAMANTHA**
 Fuck.

**SAMANTHA**
 I tried to get a hold of my contact, Michelle. She's not answering me. She must know by now what I've done. I've known her for 15 years.

**NIA**
 In the end they always find out how psycho you are.

**SAMANTHA**
 Did you find a boat to get me back to The Hive?

**NIA**
 There's a marina about 5 minutes from you. You should be able to catch a ride there.

**SAMANTHA**
 Great. I've got a unit in my rear view trying to pull me over. Do they know it's me?

**NIA**
 Checking... Well, this car wasn't reported stolen yet. I don't think so.

**SAMANTHA**
 Should I pull over?

**NIA**
 Can you outrun them?

**SAMANTHA**
 Not in this thing.

**NIA**
 Then pull over. You still have that ID we gave you for extraction?

**SAMANTHA**
 Yeah. Amanda Carpenter.

**NIA**
 Okay, I'll update the DMV registration to match it. See if you can talk your way out of this.

**OFFICER**
 Put your hands up!

**NIA**
 Oh fuck.

**SAMANTHA**
 They've got guns drawn, Nia. I think they know who I am.

**NIA**
 Shit. I just saw facial recognition picked you up at a traffic cam a mile back. Can you drive off?

**SAMANTHA**
 Not without them shooting me.

**OFFICER**
 Roll down your window and put your hand out the vehicle!

**NIA**
 Shit, shit, shit.

**SAMANTHA**
 I'm just gonna do what they say.

**OFFICER**
 Now slowly use your left hand to open the door from the outside!

**NIA**
 Wait, wait, wait wait. Sam, don't don't... don't open the door.

**SAMANTHA**
 Why not?

**NIA**
 There's a house to your left. 2057 is the number. Is the garage door open or closed?

**SAMANTHA**
 Closed. Why?

**NIA**
 Well, fuck it. Okay. Get ready to drive when I tell you to.

**OFFICER**
 With your left hand, open the door from the outside... Now!

**SAMANTHA**
 What are you planning?

**NIA**
 There is a Volterra V2 SUV in that garage. I'm gonna take it out for a little spin. Are you ready?

**OFFICER**
 Comply with our directions or we will— What? Go away...

**SAMANTHA**
 Ready.

**NIA**
 Now!

**PARKING ATTENDANT**
 Excuse me, you cannot park there, that's a reserve spot.

**SAMANTHA**
 Well, the sign has a number for a tow truck if you want to move it.

**NIA**
 Do you see the marina office?

**SAMANTHA**
 Yes.

**NIA**
 Okay they should keep copies of ignition keys for every boat there. The one you're looking for belongs to Damon Kingsley. Slip 17. Vessel name is 'The Write-Off'.

**SAMANTHA**
 Who's Damon Kingsley?

**NIA**
 Some fucking rich asshole who, based on what I can gather from OSINT, has built himself a shit reputation among the marina staff.

**SAMANTHA**
 That'll work.

**CLERK**
 Hi, can I help you?

**SAMANTHA**
 Uh, I'm here to pick up some ignition keys?

**CLERK**
 I hope you're not planning on going out there right now. What's the vessel?

**SAMANTHA**
 'The Write-Off', it's slip 17.

**CLERK**
 Okay. And are you an authorized user?

**SAMANTHA**
 Oh, I'm not sure. My name is Amanda Carpenter. Here's my ID.

**CLERK**
 No, uh, you're not on here. I'm sorry but I can't give you a key if you're not on the list.

**SAMANTHA**
 Okay look, I... I messed up. It's my boss's boat and I was supposed to get this done last week but I forgot.

**CLERK**
 Well I can just call your boss to get this sorted.

**SAMANTHA**
 No, please. If Mr. Kingsley finds out I messed up, he'll be so mad.

**NIA**
 Sell it Sam, you need this job.

**SAMANTHA**
 Please, I need this job.

**CLERK**
 You work for Mr. Kingsley?

**SAMANTHA**
 I just started. Do you know him?

**CLERK**
 I know him. You have my sincerest condolences.

**SAMANTHA**
 Oh, thank you so so much.

**CLERK**
 Word of advice though? Look for a new job.

**SAMANTHA**
 Yeah, I'm in the market.

**SAMANTHA**
 I'm at 'The Write-Off'.

**NIA**
 Release the lines before you get on board. There should be three of them. You want to go from bow to stern.

**SAMANTHA**
 Okay. What's next?

**NIA**
 Okay the key you have will start the engine but you don't have the cabin key to get on board. You might have to break a window.

**SAMANTHA**
 It's unlocked.

**NIA**
 He's cocky with assholes.

**SAMANTHA**
 I'm inside. Making my way to the controls. Yeah I started the boat but um... what do I do now?

**NIA**
 Uh, I'm not... I'm not sure. What are you seeing?

**SAMANTHA**
 I'm seeing a lot of complicated looking controls. What do you mean you're not sure?

**NIA**
 Sam, I grew up in the desert working for gangs, okay? Forgive me if I'm not a fucking yacht expert.

**SAMANTHA**
 Fair enough.

**NIA**
 Shit. You're gonna have to make an educated guess. The cops just found your car. Only a matter of time before they swarm the docks.

**SAMANTHA**
 Well, here goes nothing.

**SAMANTHA**
 I'm on the way to you.

**NIA**
 Sounds like a bit of a dock is coming with you.

**SAMANTHA**
 I can see The Hive oil platform now. I'll be there soon.

**NIA**
 Uh oh.

**NIA**
 Doesn't seem like anyone's following you. I think you're clean.

**SAMANTHA**
 Yeah Nia? That was quick thinking with the police back there. Thanks for getting me out in one piece.

**NIA**
 We make a good team. You might be too psycho for everyone else, but you're just psycho enough for me.

**NIA**
 By the way, did you find anything at Dubeck's house?

**SAMANTHA**
 No. Nothing significant. Just...

**SAMANTHA**
 Can you use the archive access to pull my operational records from Dubeck's death? I think the file code is 24COS0184.

**NIA**
 Okay.

**SAMANTHA**
 In the evidence gathered from his house, there were fragments from a number of laptops. See if the analysts figured out what model the laptops were from.

**NIA**
 Yes, it's here. Huh. Wait. It's odd. He had a ThinkPad X1 which makes sense...

**SAMANTHA**
 Yeah, that's the one I pulled the initial data from.

**NIA**
 Yeah yeah but the rest of the fragments were all identified to be from Novabooks.

**SAMANTHA**
 Novabooks?

**NIA**
 Budget laptops. You probably get more processing power from an iPod Nano.

**SAMANTHA**
 Nia. Listen to me. Go down the hall to Gannon's room. His password is 1875. I need you to check and see if there's anything on his desk.

**NIA**
 How do you know his password?

**SAMANTHA**
 Just go now.

**NIA**
 Okay, okay, I'm going.

**SAMANTHA**
 Is someone there?

**NIA**
 Okay Sam, um, I'm in Gannon's room. His desk is... covered in laptops. Boxes full of them.

**SAMANTHA**
 Oh my god.

**NIA**
 And they're Novabooks too. The same model as the one at Dubeck's house.

**SAMANTHA**
 Nia, you have to gather everyone and get out.

**DAMON KINGSLEY**
 Who do you think you can steal my boat?

**NIA**
 Sam? Sam what's going on?

**DAMON KINGSLEY**
 You hear that?! That's for you!

**NIA**
 Get what? What do you want me to get, Sam?

Peekaboo!

You can trust me.

**SAMANTHA**
 It turns out the reason the cabin door was unlocked was because Mr. Kingsley was on the boat when I stole it. Apparently he was using it as a location for his extramarital trysts. And he found me and cut off my airway just in time to stop me from telling Nia to get out.

**INTERROGATOR**
 You knew what was about to happen?

**SAMANTHA**
 It all clicked. You know, I realized what had seemed so odd about the keycap. I found the burn marks were on the underside. That was why they found fragments from all of those useless laptops in Dubeck's house. They weren't laptops at all. They were bombs.

**SAMANTHA**
 Whoever bought that massive purchase of explosives, whether it was Dubeck or Eli or more likely Gannon given his past as an arms dealer... they'd hidden the explosives inside these Novabooks.

**SAMANTHA**
 And given that Eli's real plan was clearly in motion, the fact that he'd left some of those laptops behind at The Hive could only mean one thing.

**INTERROGATOR**
 He was cleaning house.

**SAMANTHA**
 And I... I couldn't warn Nia in time.

**INTERROGATOR**
 Just more collateral damage, huh?

**DAMON KINGSLEY**
 She's awake!

**OFFICER**
 Samantha Sloane. Finally caught up to you. You're pretty slippery, but you can't run away forever. Let's get her off this boat.

**SAMANTHA**
 No, no! Wait! The oil platform is...

**DAMON KINGSLEY**
 What did she say?

**OFFICER**
 Holy shit!

**DAMON KINGSLEY**
 What the fuck was that?

**SAMANTHA**
 No!
