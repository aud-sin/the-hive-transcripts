**ALL**
 Tie the knot, you can't untie. Tie the knot, you can't untie. Tie the knot, you can't untie.

**LUMINARY**
 Tetra? What is the vulnerability in System B?

**YOUNG SAM (TETRA)**
 An oversized ICMP packet would freeze the target system.

**LUMINARY**
 Good.

**ALL**
 Tie the knot, you can't untie. Tie the knot, you can't untie. Tie the knot, you can't untie.

**LUMINARY**
 Beetle. What is the defensive flaw in System D?

**BEETLE**
 Go to hell.

**LUMINARY**
 Say that again, Beetle?

**BEETLE**
 I said go to hell! You can't do this to us! I want to go home! I want to go home! I want to go home!

**THE ASCENDANT**
 Luminary, take him for correction.

**BEETLE**
 No! No! No! No!

**ALL**
 Tie the knot, you can't untie. Tie the knot, you can't untie. Tie the knot, you can't untie.

**SAMANTHA**
 Nia brought me back to The Hive to talk with Eli about the plan to get the Project Oxcart files.

**ELI COOPER**
 Ah. Well, I greet you at the banks of the Rubicon, Sam. Guess what? No going back past this point.

**ELI COOPER**
 So, the question is... how far are you willing to go to find answers? Hmm?

**SAMANTHA**
 You were right, Eli. What you said to me in my apartment... I... I don't have friends. I don't have family. I don't even know who I am.

**SAMANTHA**
 If I turn back now, I'm going to live half of a life.

**SAMANTHA**
 If there is even a chance that... that missing part of me is somewhere in those files, I'll... I'll do whatever it takes to get them.

**ELI COOPER**
 Good. Now, given your access, Sam, the target that makes the most sense is the CIA's server room in Langley.

**ELI COOPER**
 Nia's been trying to breach it remotely for months, but, you know. No dice.

**NIA**
 Yes. If we can get a remote access terminal set up on that server, we'll be able to find everything we're looking for.

**SAMANTHA**
 Well, I... I don't have clearance to get up to the server room.

**ELI COOPER**
 And you don't know anybody who could get you access?

**SAMANTHA**
 I do have a friend with connections at that level, but I'm... not sure how she feels about me right now. I kind of ignored her last message.

**ELI COOPER**
 Alright, well, to be blunt, Sam, if she's your "friend", then that's a vulnerability I know that you know how to exploit, right?

**ELI COOPER**
 I mean, it might be painful, but that's all that stands between us and the answers that we have been waiting for.

**SAMANTHA**
 I'll make the connect. What happens once I get access?

**ELI COOPER**
 Yeah, so that's where the rest of us come in. Gannon and I are going to be standing by to receive the files and as soon as we have them, we're going to turn the volume on this shit up to eleven.

**ELI COOPER**
 So by the time the evening news comes out, we're all going to be famous. Which means, we're also going to be targets.

**ELI COOPER**
 So do not dilly-dally making your way out of there, okay?

**SAMANTHA**
 Do you think people will believe us?

**ELI COOPER**
 If we make enough noise, they will. Alright? Let's get to work.

**MICHELLE**
 Sam! So... where have you been?

**SAMANTHA**
 I'll tell you everything once we meet up at our usual spot?

**SAMANTHA**
 It hurt me to betray Michelle, but... deep down... maybe I always knew it was a possibility.

**SAMANTHA**
 Again and again, I've hurt everybody who gets close to me. I'm a broken weapon. And it's time to find out who made me.

**MICHELLE**
 Well, if it isn't my park bench companion. Good to see you after you ghosted me. My granddaughter taught me that one, you know, I like to stay current.

**SAMANTHA**
 Sorry I didn't answer your call, you sounded worried.

**MICHELLE**
 I did? Oh, that's... that's what I get for calling after a couple of glasses of wine. Turns me into a total sap.

**MICHELLE**
 Marcos is the worried one. With you gone, there's been nobody to make him look good while he sits on his ass.

**SAMANTHA**
 I'm fine. I wanted to meet with you because... I was right, Michelle. This case is bigger than I could have imagined.

**SAMANTHA**
 I know Marcos tried to bring me in yesterday, but I'm not ready to be off this just yet. There's one last piece of the puzzle missing and to get it, I need access to the Langley server room.

**SAMANTHA**
 I know I have asked a lot of you already and I... I just need you to trust me a little bit further. Can you help me get the clearance?

**MICHELLE**
 I can definitely look into that for you. But, uh... first tell me more about this case.

**MICHELLE**
 I heard you were going after this cybersecurity guy? Eli Cooper?

**SAMANTHA**
 Something felt off. I wasn't sure what.

**SAMANTHA**
 Where are all the kids?

**MICHELLE**
 Still in class, I imagine.

**SAMANTHA**
 Did you tell anyone we were meeting?

**MICHELLE**
 Of course not. Listen, Sam. This Eli Cooper is a much more dangerous individual than he appears. You haven't made contact with him yet, have you?

**SAMANTHA**
 That's when I saw the van creeping up around the corner.

**MICHELLE**
 Sam, are you okay?

**SAMANTHA**
 I knew it was here for me. I had to trust my instincts. I'm sorry, Michelle. I have to go.

**MICHELLE**
 Sam, where are you going? Sam, come back!

**SAMANTHA**
 Who am I? I can't— Michelle, I'm sorry!

**MICHELLE**
 Sam!

**MICHELLE**
 Sam, what's wrong? Sam!

**INTERROGATOR**
 Hold on a second. This was yesterday morning?

**SAMANTHA**
 Yes. Lady Bird Johnson Park on Columbia Island.

**INTERROGATOR**
 As far as I know, there weren't any operatives sent to look for you there.

**SAMANTHA**
 Did you ask Michelle?

**INTERROGATOR**
 I've actually been trying to get in touch with her to corroborate your story. But we haven't been able to make contact. Do you know anything about that?

**SAMANTHA**
 No.

**INTERROGATOR**
 What happened after you ran away from the park?

**SAMANTHA**
 Well obviously the whole plan had just gone sideways, so I called Nia for support.

**NIA**
 What? You... you saw a van? You realize not every van is a strike team waiting to grab you, right?

**SAMANTHA**
 Something was off, Nia! I just know it.

**NIA**
 Okay. Fine. Come back to The Hive, we'll regroup, we'll figure out a new plan.

**SAMANTHA**
 No, the net's only going to get tighter right now. They might just be after me. But... if they find out what we're looking for... we'll never get it.

**SAMANTHA**
 If we're going to do this, it has to be done right now.

**NIA**
 What do you mean?

**SAMANTHA**
 I'm going to Langley.

**NIA**
 Are you insane? We do not have a plan!

**SAMANTHA**
 We don't need a plan! We'll figure it out as we go.

**SAMANTHA**
 If the CIA really did mold us into weapons then... maybe it's time to act like one.

**SAMANTHA**
 I'm pulling up to the security booth now. There are a couple of cars ahead of me, but... I'll need to figure out a way to get through.

**NIA**
 What? Don't you have an access badge?

**SAMANTHA**
 I'd already be flagged. I can't take the risk.

**NIA**
 Do you know the guard?

**SAMANTHA**
 His name is, um... Ramirez. Eddie Ramirez. I've never talked to him though.

**NIA**
 Real social butterfly at work, aren't you?

**SAMANTHA**
 No, not really.

**NIA**
 Alright, well what's... what's his vibe? Could you flirt your way in?

**SAMANTHA**
 Flirt? With him?

**NIA**
 Yeah, look, I'm looking him up right now. He is kind of cute. I mean, I'm not sure what your type is, but—

**SAMANTHA**
 Um, yeah, okay. Yeah, I could... I could do this. I'll just go up and ask him about his interests.

**NIA**
 You gon' ask him about his inter—?

**SAMANTHA**
 What's wrong with that?

**NIA**
 How about you unbutton your blouse a bit, tell him that if he opens his gate, you'll open your—

**SAMANTHA**
 I'm wearing a turtleneck!

**NIA**
 Of course you are. You... Okay, scrap the flirting.

**SAMANTHA**
 What do you mean? I mean the next car up— Nia, I need a vector!

**NIA**
 I know, I know! I'm looking!

**SAMANTHA**
 Nia, I'm up, I need something!

**NIA**
 Hang on! I just got access to his financial records. Huh. Okay, okay! He is struggling financially. I think he's got a gambling problem. But I am not a hundred percent.

**EDDIE**
 Morning. Got your badge?

**SAMANTHA**
 I actually left my badge at the office yesterday. I need to go in to get it.

**EDDIE**
 Come on. You know I can't let you in without a badge.

**SAMANTHA**
 You know me, Eddie. You've seen me come through here all the time.

**EDDIE**
 It's protocol, ma'am. As I'm sure you're well aware, letting you in without a badge would be a major security risk.

**SAMANTHA**
 You know what else is a major security risk? Employees with gambling problems. Look, I wasn't going to say anything, but your name came up in an internal investigation.

**EDDIE**
 That's... that's not— There's no problem. And how do they know that, anyway?

**SAMANTHA**
 I believe you. I'm sure you have everything under control and I'm happy to pass that along, but I can't do so until I get back to the office.

**SAMANTHA**
 Do you want to delay me from doing that?

**EDDIE**
 Okay. You can go in.

**SAMANTHA**
 Thank you.

**EDDIE**
 But I'll need someone to come down and meet you at building security and take you back to your office. That's the best I can do for you.

**EDDIE**
 What's your name again?

**SAMANTHA**
 Samantha Sloane. I'm a cyber operations officer.

**EDDIE**
 Okay. They'll be waiting for you inside. Go on through.

**SAMANTHA**
 Did you get all that?

**NIA**
 Yep. We almost got through clean. But if you're flagged in the system they definitely gonna pop you now.

**SAMANTHA**
 I know. Shit.

**NIA**
 Look, it's not too late to turn around. Sam, don't throw away our best chance at this.

**SAMANTHA**
 No, I'm not. I... I'll figure it out.

**COLLEAGUE**
 Sam? Is that you?

**SAMANTHA**
 Oh. Hello.

**COLLEAGUE**
 Marcos has been looking for you.

**SAMANTHA**
 Yeah, I know. I'm... I'm actually just now going to check in.

**MARCOS**
 Samantha Sloane?

**NIA**
 Sam, you need to run. You need to get out of there.

**SAMANTHA**
 It's too late. Just a second, I have to dip into the bathroom.

**MARCOS**
 Sloane? I need to speak with you!

**NIA**
 Sam, I'm not gonna lie to you. I think you might be fucked.

**SAMANTHA**
 No, I can still do this. We just need to evacuate the building.

**NIA**
 Evacuate the building?

**SAMANTHA**
 It's happened before. In 2002. For a fire.

**NIA**
 Okay. Okay, so pull a fucking fire alarm.

**SAMANTHA**
 Even if I could reach one, they'd know it was fake.

**MARCOS**
 Samantha! Please... come out of there!

**SAMANTHA**
 I'm indecent! I just need some privacy!

**NIA**
 Well, you're gonna have plenty of privacy in whatever cell they're about to throw you in!

**SAMANTHA**
 Just give me a second, okay? I... I'm going to listen to my music. I need to think for a bit.

**NIA**
 What?

**SAMANTHA**
 I'll call you back.

**NIA**
 Sam, don't—!

**SECURITY GUARD**
 Open up!

**SAMANTHA**
 Got it.

**NIA**
 Sam, what the fuck?

**SAMANTHA**
 Stop talking and listen. The Langley cafeteria recently installed these new smart combination ovens. I believe the brand name is AutoCook. There's a vulnerability in the connectivity software.

**SAMANTHA**
 It was fixed in the latest patch, which I told them about and told them to update, but there is a chance they ignored me.

**SAMANTHA**
 Look up the patch and reverse engineer the fix to find the vulnerability. Then see if you can locate the ovens at this location.

**NIA**
 I'm already on it.

**MARCOS**
 Do you have the key?

**COLLEAGUE**
 Yeah, on my desk.

**MARCOS**
 Go. Go on and get it.

**COLLEAGUE**
 Oh, yeah. Okay.

**SAMANTHA**
 Nia, once you get in, push the gas flow, shut off the cooling fan and overwrite the thermostat values to appear negative. The system should try and compensate.

**NIA**
 Yup, yep, yep. Already way ahead of you.

**COLLEAGUE**
 Got the key.

**MARCOS**
 Give it here.

**SAMANTHA**
 Nia, I am out of time!

**NIA**
 I think I did it. Oh! Did it work?

**COLLEAGUE**
 It's that one there.

**SAMANTHA**
 I... I don't know. Nothing's happening.

**COLLEAGUE**
 What the hell was that?

**MARCOS**
 Holy shit!

**SAMANTHA**
 I think it worked!

**MARCOS**\NEveryone stay calm. Okay? Follow your evacuation route.\N**COLLEAGUE**\NGo, go, go!\N**MARCOS**\NDon't even worry about your personal items! Just get out!

**SAMANTHA**
 I can do this. I need to do this.

**SAMANTHA**
 Okay, I am past security heading to the server floors.

**NIA**
 You good? You okay?

**SAMANTHA**
 It's a little smoky down here.

**NIA**
 Uh, okay, I'm seeing that every emergency service in DC just got alerted to a major incident at Langley. Ha! How big is that fire?

**SAMANTHA**
 It's um... it's big. You did good work.

**NIA**
 So much for quiet in and out.

**SAMANTHA**
 Okay, I am almost at the server room. I can reach it by going through my old office. Hopefully they've all evacuated already.

**SAMANTHA**
 Shit. My keycard won't open the door. They must have already revoked my access.

**NIA**
 Can you pop the hinges?

**SAMANTHA**
 No. But... it's motion activated on the other side. Maybe I can find something in one of these desks to trigger it.

**SAMANTHA**
 This might work.

**NIA**
 What? What might work?

**SAMANTHA**
 A compressed air duster. If you spray it upside down, it'll make clouds of tetrafluoroethylene that might be visible enough to trip the sensor.

**SAMANTHA**
 If I stick the nozzle under the door frame...

**SAMANTHA**
 Oh come on...

**NIA**
 Is it working? Talk to me. Is it—?

**SAMANTHA**
 Not yet.

**SAMANTHA**
 Got it!

**NIA**
 Nice work!

**SAMANTHA**
 Now I just have to—

**MARCOS**
 Sloane!

**MARCOS**
 What are you doing here?

**SAMANTHA**
 Marcos. Hi.

**MARCOS**
 Were you trying to open this door?

**NIA**
 Who the fuck is that?

**SAMANTHA**
 It's my boss!

**MARCOS**
 Who are you talking to?

**NIA**
 Sam, what is going—

**MARCOS**
 You know, we've been looking for you. For weeks.

**SAMANTHA**
 Yeah, I know. I was just, um...

**MARCOS**
 No, no, I don't want to hear it. Uh, we're supposed to be evacuating and you're... I don't know what you're doing. You need to come with me right now.

**SAMANTHA**
 Yes, sir.

**MARCOS**
 I've put up with a lot of your shit over the years, Sloane. But this really takes the cake. I don't care what friends you have with the higher-ups.

**MARCOS**
 This time, you're gone. And I am making sure they do a full investigation into whatever freak shit you've been up to.

**SAMANTHA**
 You know, sir. I've put up with a lot of your shit too.

**MARCOS**
 Oh really? You want to go there, Sloane?

**SAMANTHA**
 Yes. You're not suited for your position. You're cocky and you constantly overlook obvious security risks. No matter how many times I notify you.

**SAMANTHA**
 It's no surprise that you've done it again.

**MARCOS**
 Done what again?

**SAMANTHA**
 Underestimated me. Look, I've been gone for weeks. I suddenly reappear under suspicious circumstances in the middle of an emergency.

**SAMANTHA**
 You caught me red-handed forcing open a door in a highly secured area and you didn't bother to restrain me.

**MARCOS**
 I didn't... What?

**NIA**
 Sam? Sam, what's going on?

**SAMANTHA**
 I just knocked my boss out with a paperweight. And now I'm tying him up with an extension cord before he wakes up.

**NIA**
 Okay, girlboss.

**SAMANTHA**
 Look, I told you. Whatever it takes. And on a convenient note, his badge should give me access the rest of the way.

**NIA**
 Okay, how long 'til you're in?

**SAMANTHA**
 Only a couple minutes. You should get Eli and tell him to be ready for the next stage of the plan.

**NIA**
 Copy.

**SAMANTHA**
 Once I was in the server room, the rest was simple. I set up the RAT like I was supposed to, giving them access back at The Hive.

**SAMANTHA**
 But I wanted to see the files for myself. Given how messy my entry was, I knew I might not make it out unscathed.

**SAMANTHA**
 This might be my only chance. So I dug through the archives on my own searching for the Project Oxcart files and... then I realized something was very wrong.

**SAMANTHA**
 Nia? Nia, are you there? I set up remote access and I found the files on Project Oxcart but... they're empty.

**SAMANTHA**
 They're tagged 35-1-D which means that they were moved because of an attempted breach... ten years ago.

**SAMANTHA**
 I... I don't understand.

**NIA**
 Sam. You need to get out of there right now.

**SAMANTHA**
 Why? What's going on?

**NIA**
 I think we're being fucked.
