# Episode 3 - The Scales of Justice
---
**LUMINARY**
 Tetra? Tetra, can you hear us?

**YOUNG SAM (TETRA)**
 Mm.

**LUMINARY**
 Okay. She’s out cold.

**THE ASCENDANT**
 Is the procedure ready?

**LUMINARY**
 We’ll start with the synthetic glial cell injection and then move to the hippocampal augmentation.

**THE ASCENDANT**
 And the synaptogenesis treatment?

**LUMINARY**
 Three procedures in one sitting? That seems—

**THE ASCENDANT**
 Do it.

**LUMINARY**
 Yes, Ascendant.

**YOUNG SAM (TETRA)**
 Mm... Mm...

**LUMINARY**
 No, no, no. This is going to help you, Tetra. This is going to make you... special.

**SAMANTHA**
 You... You all come from the same place as me.

**NIA**
 It’s good to see you again. Tetra.

**ELI COOPER**
 I think you’ve earned your spot on the team.

**INTERROGATOR**
 So, that’s when you joined them?

**SAMANTHA**
 No. That’s when I grabbed Eli and put a knife to his throat.

**ELI COOPER**
 Whoa! Okay!

**NIA**
 Whoa! Put the knife down, Sam!

**ELI COOPER**
 That’s... that’s not the reaction I usually get after promoting someone, but I... oh, I love the passion!

**GANNON**
 Drop the knife! Or I'll shoot.

**ELI COOPER**
 Seriously, Gannon? Again with the gun? Let’s just put the toys away and talk like adults, alright? We’re all on the same team here.

**SAMANTHA**
 People on my team don’t lie to me. You lured me here. From the very beginning. No more games. No more tests. No more deception. I want to know exactly what is going on here right now.

**SAMANTHA**
 What is the purpose of The Hive?

**ELI COOPER**
 God. The purpose of The Hive is to find out what was done to all of you. To everyone who was a part of that monstrous program and to help bring you justice. Do you not get that?

**SAMANTHA**
 You’re trying to help me?

**ELI COOPER**
 Yes!

**SAMANTHA**
 You mean just like you helped Alan Dubeck?

**ELI COOPER**
 Easy with that knife, alright? I wanted to help Alan. I loved Alan. More than you know. I did everything I could for him.

**SAMANTHA**
 Does that include blowing him up?

**ELI COOPER**
 No. God... Alan... Alan was my partner. We built The Hive together. Even the name was his idea, inspired by what they called him in the program. Honeybee.

**ELI COOPER**
 But, towards the end, he lost his mind. It was probably never fully there after what the program did to him, but in the last few months, he became... manic. He became paranoid. He was reaching out to dangerous people, trying to get weapons. We had no choice but to expel him from The Hive before he ruined everything that we were building here. I don’t know what happened to him after that, alright? I swear.

**NIA**
 He’s telling the truth, Sam.

**ELI COOPER**
 Alan couldn’t overcome the scars the program left him with. He wasn’t the first one.

**SAMANTHA**
 There were more?

**NIA**
 Best we can tell there were about fifty children in that program with us. We spent a lot of resources trying to find survivors, but... we’re pretty much all that’s left. A lot of the survivors had full psychiatric breaks and ended up hospitalized or homeless. More died by suicide. Nobody got out clean.

**GANNON**
 Let me guess. You always thought that you were one of the unlucky ones?

**SAMANTHA**
 What are you doing?

**GANNON**
 You know why I wear this hat everywhere?

**NIA**
 Is it because you’re basing your personality off a character on Yellowstone?

**GANNON**
 It’s because I look a lot prettier with this hat on... than when I take it off.

**SAMANTHA**
 What is that?

**GANNON**
 I don’t remember the fancy name the doctor had for it. But he said it’d kill me in a year. And that was... was well right about a year ago. Now that I think about it. So, you should understand how important it is for me to get justice for what happened to us. And I ain’t gonna let you, or nobody else, stand in the way of what we built here with Eli.

**SAMANTHA**
 So... you’re all trying to find out who did this to us?

**ELI COOPER**
 Sam, give us a little credit. We already know who did it.

**SAMANTHA**
 You do?

**ELI COOPER**
 Sure, Nia?

**NIA**
 Fine. But you have to come back inside, Sam.

**SAMANTHA**
 I’m keeping the knife.

**ELI COOPER**
 Eh. Suit yourself.

**NIA**
 What have you uncovered about what happened to you as a child?

**SAMANTHA**
 I pulled every record I could find. When I was seven, I ran away from my fourth foster home and was placed into a behavioral treatment facility. At which point there is an eighteen-month gap in my life.

**NIA**
 Meadows Behavioral Hospital. They used to have locations all around the country.

**ELI COOPER**
 My god, I still remember the commercials they would run with that stupid tagline. "Supporting your children when they need it most." It was bullshit.

**GANNON**
 Well, in the late nineties, when they started running low on funds, they began leasing out patients to whatever research project showed up with a grant.

**ELI COOPER**
 I mean, you gotta keep the shareholders happy, right?

**NIA**
 Yeah, someone has gone to great lengths to remove all traces of the research project that Meadows transferred us to. But we found this hard copy document in one of their abandoned offices.

**SAMANTHA**
 Agreement with Pinecrest University to select patients for clinical study based on... aforementioned criteria.

**NIA**
 And that criteria being kids who displayed above-average intelligence but were troubled.

**ELI COOPER**
 Mmhmm.

**NIA**
 Kids who had gotten into fights or runaways. And a higher priority placed on children coming from foster homes. The ones who nobody particularly cared what happened to.

**ELI COOPER**
 Or kids whose parents couldn’t control them. So that if they were to come home with stories of being tortured, they wouldn’t necessarily be believed.

**SAMANTHA**
 And this Pinecrest University?

**NIA**
 Doesn’t exist. It’s just a shell.

**ELI COOPER**
 Yup.

**NIA**
 No employees, locations, or any discernible purpose. It was set up by Eclipse Global Partners which in turn was set up by Nixoro Capital.

**SAMANTHA**
 They’re all shell companies.

**GANNON**
 A Russian nesting doll with no end. No matter how deep we dug, we could never trace it back to a real source.

**ELI COOPER**
 So instead, we started thinking about who would construct a web like this.

**SAMANTHA**
 I see criminal enterprises set up shell companies all the time.

**NIA**
 Yeah, but this many layers? All seeming completely above board? Never raising any hint of suspicion?

**SAMANTHA**
 It... does fit the hallmarks of government operation, but...

**ELI COOPER**
 You thought it was a cult, didn’t you?

**SAMANTHA**
 It had to have been a cult. The way they talked to us, the rituals they made us do.

**NIA**
 This document... look. It popped up on WikiLeaks in 2012. Dated 2002. It’s buried so deep in unrelated files that we didn’t even find it for years. But it’s publicly available info. This section right here?

**SAMANTHA**
 "For selected operations in which assets must remain unaware of our involvement... using terminology and behavior borrowed from cults may help to further conceal our identity. Recently, Project Oxcart used fictitious rituals and codenames such as 'Luminary' and 'Ascendant'..."

**ELI COOPER**
 Hmm.

**SAMANTHA**
 "...to hide the involvement of the CIA."

**ELI COOPER**
 So now you see why I couldn’t exactly just show up at your office and ask you to join us. I mean, I apologize for the deception, but it was the only way to bring you on board.

**SAMANTHA**
 It has to be a coincidence. They wouldn’t—

**ELI COOPER**
 Oh, they wouldn’t? The same people who did MKUltra? The people who destabilized Africa and flooded the streets with crack cocaine? You think they wouldn’t torture a few little kids the world has forgotten about? I hate to break it to you, Sam, but they ain’t exactly Doctors Without Borders.

**SAMANTHA**
 Is this the only proof you have?

**NIA**
 No, of course not. Check it out. Look. Hundreds of pages. Financial documents, travel records, leaked government contracts. Insider sources that all confirm the existence of Project Oxcart.

**NIA**
 And just think about what they were teaching us. The stuff they were training our minds to do. They were... they were trying to make us into weapons, Sam. Who would benefit from that? Some techno-cult?

**SAMANTHA**
 So... who was in charge?

**ELI COOPER**
 Well, that’s what we’re trying to figure out.

**SAMANTHA**
 That’s why you need me here. You want me to get you into the CIA’s records.

**NIA**
 We need the files on Project Oxcart. If we get those files, we’ll know exactly who was responsible.

**GANNON**
 And what the fuck they did to us.

**NIA**
 And we can share it all with the world.

**ELI COOPER**
 We can hold those motherfuckers accountable.

**SAMANTHA**
 You’re asking me to commit treason.

**ELI COOPER**
 What? Your country betrayed you, Sam. What I’m asking you to do is to deliver justice.

**SAMANTHA**
 I want to leave.

**GANNON**
 She’s not going anywhere. She knows too much.

**ELI COOPER**
 No, she is. You can take my boat.

**GANNON**
 Have you fucking lost it?

**ELI COOPER**
 Sam is one of us. If she wants to run back to her bosses and turn us in, fine. But we’ve done what we can and she knows what we stand for, don’t you? The rest is in her hands.

**INTERROGATOR**
 Wow. So... you’re telling me that after all of that, Eli just let you walk away?

**SAMANTHA**
 He didn’t even come on the boat. He let Nia take me.

**INTERROGATOR**
 And what were you planning to do once you got to shore?

**SAMANTHA**
 I was going to come in and debrief.

**INTERROGATOR**
 So at this point, you had no intention of working with Eli?

**SAMANTHA**
 What Eli told me was shocking. But I’ve been working for the CIA for over a decade. I wasn’t just going to instantly drop everything and betray my country, my employers... Not to mention Michelle. The only person who has ever looked out for me.

**SAMANTHA**
 So, you were really in the program too?

**NIA**
 I don’t seem fucked up enough for you? Let me guess. You recognized me from whatever watchlist I’m on. Think I’m just a thief? Career criminal who cares only about herself, yeah?

**SAMANTHA**
 You stole a hundred million dollars in crypto that went directly into financing a drug cartel.

**NIA**
 When I was eight years old, I got caught shoplifting. It was my sister’s birthday. I really wanted to get her one of those slices of cake... you know, the ones they keep in those little plastic containers at the Bi-Lo? And the people who were staying with me at the time, they were more than happy to turn me over to Meadows. Especially when they were told that a research grant would cover the cost of my treatment. And then the little girl named Nia disappeared into that black hole. And the thing they call Raptor... came out the other side.

**SAMANTHA**
 Raptor.

**NIA**
 Now look when I got back to the world, I did a lot of bad things. I got into drugs. Became indebted to the local gangs. Look, I almost lost my sister in the process. But all I had was my skill set. And in the end... a hundred million dollars? Was the price of our freedom. And I know that money has gone toward hurting people. I know that. And that’s something I gotta live with. But it’s not something I regret.

**SAMANTHA**
 I guess you are kind of fucked up.

**NIA**
 That’s funny. You’re very direct.

**NIA**
 And we are here.

**SAMANTHA**
 Hey, um... I’m sorry I broke into your computer.

**NIA**
 Yeah, normally I’d tag you back for that, but... I know why you did it. Because you’re as desperate to find the truth as I am. I really hope you make the right decision, Sam.

**SAMANTHA**
  After getting ashore, I went straight to the nearest diner.

**WAITRESS**
 Booth or counter, sweetheart?

**SAMANTHA**
 Um, anywhere with an outlet?

**WAITRESS**
 An outlet?

**SAMANTHA**
 I need to charge a few things, I’ve... been offshore for the past few weeks.

**WAITRESS**
 Ah, fishing trip?

**SAMANTHA**
 No.

**WAITRESS**
 Are you okay, honey?

**SAMANTHA**
 Not really. Um... you know, I fear I’m about to betray my own past in service of my country.

**WAITRESS**
 Oh. Well... why don’t you take this booth right here and I’ll go grab you a menu.

**SAMANTHA**
 There’s no need for me to reach out to the agency. I’d disappeared in the field over three weeks ago. As soon as I turned on my phone, it would take thirty seconds for someone in my division to get alerted of my location. Probably another minute for them to dispatch the nearest operative who would arrive at my location to bring me in within... five minutes? Marcos would be even more pissed than when I’d left. And they’d make me undergo a rigorous debrief. But nothing I couldn’t smooth out as long as... I turned over Eli and everybody in The Hive.

**SAMANTHA**
 While I waited, I listened to... the message Michelle had left me.

**MICHELLE**
 Sam... I don’t know how else to reach you. Please contact me. Whatever is going on, we can fix it. We can make everything go back to normal.

**SAMANTHA**
 Make everything go back to normal. As I sat in that diner knowing that the agency would be there to pick me up in four minutes... three minutes... I saw all the "normal" life around me.

**DINER PATRON 1**
 Are you coming to the party tonight?

**DINER PATRON 2**
 Yes, but I don't know what to wear! Like, what are you bringing?

**DINER PATRON 3**
 Did you hear Todd got engaged?

**DINER PATRON 1**
 I know!

**DINER PATRON 4**
 You kids aren't getting pie! We already got ice cream today!

**DINER PATRON 5**
 Ah, come on! This is a vacation! Let 'em have fun!

**DINER PATRON 6**
 Thanks so much. Thank you, Debbie.

**SAMANTHA**
 Two...two minutes.

**INTERROGATOR**
 So, you’re not normal. Who is in this field? That’s not exactly motivation to commit treason.

**SAMANTHA**
 I don’t think you understand. I mean... whatever they did to us in the program didn’t just traumatize us. It reformatted the part of us that’s... that’s human.

**INTERROGATOR**
 What do you mean?

**SAMANTHA**
 Imagine you have a friend who posts on social media that they’re expecting a baby. And they include a photo of the happy couple with the ultrasound and you might think, "Oh, that’s beautiful. I am so happy for them." You know, a healthy, human emotional response.

**SAMANTHA**
 But I look at that post and I... I see fifteen ways to steal their identity. My mind has already made a plan to drain the college fund of that kid. I know exactly what to leverage to turn the father into an asset who would do anything I ask of him while I deconstruct his life.

**INTERROGATOR**
 And you’re doing this all the time?

**SAMANTHA**
 I don’t even need a computer. They built me to find vulnerabilities in systems. But... but systems are just echoes of their human creators. Based on your name... Brooks Alder? Your demeanor, your aversion to foul language, and your facial tics when I’ve previously described drug and alcohol use? You see... there’s a very high probability that you’re Mormon. Or more likely, given your lack of wedding ring, ex-Mormon. You have a complicated relationship with your family, and in particular with your father, that could be exploited. You told me in our conversation that you have a child. Which was a mistake. Because I’ve already filed that unprompted information into the part of my brain that is busy making a plan to destroy you.

**INTERROGATOR**
 Is that what you want? To destroy me?

**SAMANTHA**
 What I want? What I want... is to go a full night without night terrors waking me up every few hours. Or to go a... a week! Just a week where I am not vomiting from headaches or falling unconscious while cooking. I... I want to be able to be close to people without hurting them. And do you know what else I want to do?

**INTERROGATOR**
 What?

**SAMANTHA**
 Die. I want to die. Not... always, but I... You know, I told you that when Eli showed up at my door, I had my service weapon stored in my car.

**INTERROGATOR**
 Yeah.

**SAMANTHA**
 Yeah, I keep it there because I’m too nervous to keep it by my bed. Whoever... was responsible for making me into this. Whether it was the CIA or someone else, I... I knew that the second I got taken into debrief... they would find The Hive and shut it down. And those answers would be lost with it.

**SAMANTHA**
 One minute until they get here. And that’s when I decided I couldn’t let them take me in. I mean, I barely remember getting up from the table.

**SAMANTHA**
 But I waited too long. Someone already came for me.

**SAMANTHA**
 There’s a woman across the street wearing a green dress and a precision watch who seemed very interested in a FedEx storefront. It’s possible, yes, that she was window shopping for shipping supplies, but it’s more likely she was watching my reflection in the glass. I needed to get off the street.

**SAMANTHA**
 [Voiceover] I ducked into the nearest metro station.

**SAMANTHA**
 I didn’t see her on the escalator, but just before the train doors closed...

**SUBWAY PA SYSTEM**
 Stand back. Doors are closing.

**SAMANTHA**
 I caught a glimpse of that same green dress boarding the train two cars back. And then I saw the dress again. Only one car away.

**SAMANTHA**
 I went the other direction. I tried to put space between us.

**PASSENGER 1**
 Excuse me. Would be nice.

**PASSENGER 2**
 Whoa, watch it!

**PASSENGER 3**
 Can you watch where you're going?

**PASSENGER 4**
 Slow down!

**SAMANTHA**
 Hold the door please!

**SAMANTHA**
 Excuse me.

**STREET MUSICIAN**
 Ma’am!

**SAMANTHA**
 I’ll give you twenty dollars if you move your setup to in front of that door.

**STREET MUSICIAN**
 But I'll block the passageway.

**STREET MUSICIAN**
 Fifty dollars.

**SAMANTHA**
 Consider it blocked! Thank you, ma'am!

**SAMANTHA**
 They’re following my phone, so I slipped it into a sleeping passenger’s bag. In thirty seconds, we’ll reach the next stop, at which point I will get off the train and just disappear.

**PASSENGERS**
 - Whoa! - Oh my god. - What was that?

**CONDUCTOR**
 Attention passengers. The train has made an emergency stop. Please remain calm and do not attempt to exit the train. This should only be a moment. Thank you.

**PASSENGERS**
 - This is the third time this week! Come on! - Unbelievable. - Tax dollars at work.

**SAMANTHA**
 Are you kidding me?

**SAMANTHA**
 I didn’t think they would stop a train just to reacquire a missing operative, but... there was also a chance this wasn’t just a friendly pickup. I wasn’t going to wait around to find out.

**PASSENGERS**
 - Whoa! - Wait! - What are you doing? - It's illegal! - Hey lady, stay on the train!

**SAMANTHA**
 There was an access door a couple of hundred feet up the opposite track. I headed that way. Being careful to avoid the third rail.

**SAMANTHA**
 I glanced back once to see the green dress still pushing through the train. Searching.

**SAMANTHA**
 I got to the access door. It was locked. Of course. So I get to work with a hairpin still standing on the track.

**SAMANTHA**
 I can feel the pins dropping into place. Now I just need to apply tension. Not too much or I’ll break it.

**SAMANTHA**
 A seven-hundred-thousand-pound train traveling at seventy-five miles per hour will hit me with about four hundred Gs of force. Enough to instantly pulverize the skeleton system and vaporize soft tissue. I turn the hairpin gently...

**SAMANTHA**
 Once I was back on the street, I used the method Eli had outlined for me to get in contact with him.

**INTERROGATOR**
 Which was?

**SAMANTHA**
 Marathon's biggest client is Ameribank. They set up a back door on the chain's ATMs, so I just had to press the "Call for Assistance" button.

**ATM VOICE**
 Hello. You have contacted the helpline for this ATM. Please state the nature of your request.

**SAMANTHA**
 Tie the knot you can’t untie.

**ATM VOICE**
 I’m sorry. I didn’t understand—

**ELI COOPER**
 Sam?

**SAMANTHA**
 I have to ask you something.

**ELI COOPER**
 Yeah?

**SAMANTHA**
 You’re older than everyone else in The Hive. You couldn’t have been a part of the program. So what’s your stake in all of this?

**ELI COOPER**
 Uh... we’ve talked about all the people who didn’t make it out of the program. My son was one of those people. I was a broke single father overwhelmed by a child I couldn’t control. I thought... hey, they told me they were going to get him help. I’ll never forgive myself for letting it happen. But at least I’ll... I’ll bring him justice.

**SAMANTHA**
 What do you need me to do?
