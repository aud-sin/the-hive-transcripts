# Episode 6 - Burn Bag
---
**LUMINARY**
 All of you, stay in line.

**YOUNG SAM (TETRA)**
 Beetle, are you ready? The doors up there on the right side lead to an exit.

**BEETLE**
 How do you know that?

**YOUNG SAM (TETRA)**
 I've seen Luminaries walk down that way with cigarettes. Smoke breaks.

**BEETLE**
 I don't know. Maybe we just stay.

**YOUNG SAM (TETRA)**
 We can't stay here. Trust me. I'll keep us safe.

**BEETLE**
 Okay. I trust you.

**YOUNG SAM (TETRA)**
 Wait for the people watching us to switch off.

**LUMINARY 1**
 Handing off?

**LUMINARY 2**
 Handing off.

**YOUNG SAM (TETRA)**
 Wait for them to turn.

**LUMINARY 1**
 Twenty-three animals in the jungle.

**LUMINARY 2**
 Twenty-three animals in the jungle.

**YOUNG SAM (TETRA)**
 Now!

**LUMINARY 1**
 Hey!

**YOUNG SAM (TETRA)**
 Quick! This way!

**THE ASCENDANT**
 All Luminaries, we have two runaways in the East Wing.

**YOUNG SAM (TETRA)**
 There's the door!

**BEETLE**
 It won't open!

**YOUNG SAM (TETRA)**
 There's a latch up at the top!

**BEETLE**
 I can't reach it!

**YOUNG SAM (TETRA)**
 Here, stand on my palms, I'll help you up!

**LUMINARY 1**
 They went this way!

**YOUNG SAM (TETRA)**
 Beetle, hurry!

**BEETLE**
 Got it.

**LUMINARY 1**
 Stop right there!

**YOUNG SAM (TETRA)**
 Go!

**SAMANTHA**
 After the explosion, they dragged me off the boat and put me in here with you. Where I've been wasting my time ever since. While the guy who killed my friend is gonna go off and kill more people and nobody's looking for him.

**INTERROGATOR**
 We're doing our jobs. There's a team looking for Eli at his office as we speak.

**SAMANTHA**
 He's not gonna be at his fucking office! He's gonna be holed up somewhere getting ready to make his next move.

**INTERROGATOR**
 His next move? Right. Let me back up for a second and see if I have this all straight. Eli Cooper has been spending the last decade-plus collecting survivors of a secret CIA program into a super-team of hackers to help him expose the truth. But once he has everybody in place, including an active CIA officer he went to incredible lengths to recruit, he disappears and kills most of the people he was working with. And you believe it's because he's planning some sort of larger attack. Help me out because I feel like I'm missing something here.

**SAMANTHA**
 That's what I missed, that's the problem. The entire time I was in The Hive, Eli kept talking about his idea of justice. Remember I told you about that teenage hacker Eli asked me to punish? The kid that was just trying to show off for internet points and Eli wanted me to destroy his entire life? And yet for the people he thinks killed his son, Eli is content with a New York Times article? That doesn't track. And I was just too distracted to see it.

**SAMANTHA**
 Whatever justice Eli is really planning... he doesn't want it paid in truth, he wants it paid in blood. Here's what I think, okay? Eli only gave us half the story because whatever he has in mind is so cruel that he knew that no one would ever go along with it. He's been using us as his pawns this whole time and now he's got the board set up exactly how he wants it.

**INTERROGATOR**
 And do you think he has more of these exploding laptops out there?

**SAMANTHA**
 I know he does. Even with a conservative estimate of how much the explosives were worth, the bombs at Dubeck's house and the oil platform were just a fraction of what he has at his disposal.

**INTERROGATOR**
 Sam... I want to believe you. But you haven't given me a single actionable lead for finding Eli.

**SAMANTHA**
 Yes I have! The Project Oxcart files!

**INTERROGATOR**
 Okay.

**SAMANTHA**
 Look, whatever he's doing is tied to those files, which are sitting in a SCIF vault somewhere in DC.

**INTERROGATOR**
 If they exist, they'd probably be above my clearance level.

**SAMANTHA**
 So put in a request! What do you have to lose?

**INTERROGATOR**
 My credibility, for one. If I'm seen to be chasing this conspiracy theory any further. I've got bosses too, Sloane. And they want me to put a bow on this whole train wreck and move on. And I've heard you out. I've done my due diligence. But at some point, I have to draw a line. I mean, how do you know there's a connection between those files and what he's planning?

**SAMANTHA**
 'Cause I think he already has them.

**SAMANTHA**
 Why would he do that unless it put his plan at risk?

**INTERROGATOR**
 In your own version of events, Eli was lying to you from the start. Isn't it possible he has no connection to this Project Oxcart whatsoever and he made it all up to manipulate you?

**SAMANTHA**
 Eli lied about a lot of things, but I know for a fact his son was in Project Oxcart.

**INTERROGATOR**
 And do you have any proof of that fact? Or am I once again to take you at your word? This conversation is going in circles. Sam, I sincerely believe that you believe what you're telling me.

**SAMANTHA**
 Don't do this.

**INTERROGATOR**
 There's just not a lot of evidence for what you've told me. That doesn't mean it's not real, but I'll tell you something that is real. Government persecution is a common manifestation of paranoid schizophrenia.

**SAMANTHA**
 I'm not crazy!

**INTERROGATOR**
 What's in the medicine you took?

**SAMANTHA**
 I don't know! Nia gave it to me.

**INTERROGATOR**
 Right. Nia Carter. A black hat hacker that nobody has seen in years. She's almost as invisible as Eli Cooper.

**SAMANTHA**
 She helped me break into Langley!

**INTERROGATOR**
 Talking to you on an earpiece that nobody else heard?

**SAMANTHA**
 I'm not insane!

**INTERROGATOR**
 That's not my judgment to make.

**SAMANTHA**
 I am telling you that there is a very motivated madman out there with weapons that he intends to use. I should be out there stopping him, but I can't because I'm trapped in here with you and that goddamn flickering light!

**SAMANTHA**
 The light...

**COLLEAGUE**
 Alder, you need to come take a look at this.

**ALDER (INTERROGATOR)**
 I'm just wrapping up.

**COLLEAGUE**
 It's urgent.

**ALDER (INTERROGATOR)**
 I'll be there in a minute.

**ALDER (INTERROGATOR)**
 Alright, I think I've got everything I can out of this interview. Next person you're going to meet with is Dr. Chin, psychologist who consults with the agency.

**ALDER (INTERROGATOR)**
 Sam?

**SAMANTHA**
 Look at the light. There's a pattern to the flickering. It's... Morse? Or no, binary?

**ALDER (INTERROGATOR)**
 Good luck, Sam. I hope you find what you're looking for.

**SAMANTHA**
 I can't believe it. Can you see me through the cameras?

**SAMANTHA**
 Now?

**SAMANTHA**
 Okay. Yeah. I'm ready. Unlock it.

**AGENTS**
 - Isn't that the guy's office? - Is this live? - Who is Eli Cooper?

**SAMANTHA**
 Can you hold the door? Thank you. I hate these trash bags leaking.

**BYSTANDER**
 Oh, ew.

**SAMANTHA**
 You know where the dumpsters are?

**BYSTANDER**
 Yeah, the back alley down that way.

**SAMANTHA**
 Thank you.

Hmm. It's about fucking time. Been flickering those lights for hours.

**SAMANTHA**
 Nia? How'd you make it out?

**NIA**
 You're not the only one who can put pieces together. Eli must have been watching the place cause shit fucking popped off the second we came through the door. We had to jump from the platform. Singed the hair off my ass cheeks.

**SAMANTHA**
 What about the others?

**NIA**
 I got everybody I could.

**SAMANTHA**
 Dylan?

**NIA**
 He's okay. But Curtis wasn't so lucky. But shit on the plus side, his stupid language died with him.

**SAMANTHA**
 How did you find me?

**NIA**
 I'm still in the CIA system. Been watching the cameras the whole time. I was really touched by how broken up you seemed about my death. Never knew you were such a softie.

**SAMANTHA**
 Shut up. Let's just get out of here before anyone realizes I'm gone.

**SAMANTHA**
 Is this your place?

**NIA**
 It's a place I stay.

**SAMANTHA**
 Should I take my shoes off?

**NIA**
 I don't care. Make yourself at home.

**SAMANTHA**
 Okay, yeah. I'm gonna leave 'em on. Actually, no, I'm gonna take 'em off. Sorry, I'm just... I'm really not good at... making myself at home.

**NIA**
 It's fine. Come here, sit down.

**NIA**
 You want a beer?

**SAMANTHA**
 Uh...

**NIA**
 I'm gonna get you one.

**SAMANTHA**
 Thanks.

**SAMANTHA**
 You know, back at the OIG building... I was able to get out because they were all distracted by something on TV.

**NIA**
 That would be because Eli Cooper just threatened the US government on CNBC.

**SAMANTHA**
 He did what?

**NIA**
 Mmhmm. Look. Take a look for yourself. It's everywhere.

**ADAM**
 [On TV] Welcome back. We have an unexpected guest on the show today. The CEO of one of the largest information security companies in the world, who does not give a lot of interviews.

**ADAM**
 [On TV] We're very lucky to welcome to the show Eli Cooper, founder of Marathon. Eli, thanks so much for calling in.

**ELI COOPER**
 [On TV] Ah, thank you so much, Adam, for having me. I know it's... I know it's kind of last minute.

**ADAM**
 [On TV] Of course. Your company, Marathon, is entrusted with protecting some of the most powerful corporations in America. And I understand that you've come on today to announce something new?

**ELI COOPER**
 [On TV] I sure have. But it has nothing to do with my business. I just said that so you'd take my call.

**ELI COOPER**
 [On TV] Many of you out there don't really know me. I'm just, you know, another boring face on your television screens. But I've been CEO of Marathon for over a decade now. But before that, I was... I was a father.

**ELI COOPER**
 [On TV] That was the most... important job of my life. I had a beautiful son... who was tragically taken from me.

**ADAM**
 [On TV] Oh, I'm... I'm so sorry. I didn't realize that. That's terrible.

**ELI COOPER**
 [On TV] Yeah, it is pretty terrible. Kind of fucked me up if I'm being honest. But his loss gave my life purpose. A determination. I knew I would not stop until I got justice for my boy.

**ADAM**
 [On TV] Really quick, Eli, if I could remind you that we are live... if you can try to avoid the colorful language. But... but that is a very noble cause. I take it you're launching a new initiative in his honor?

**ELI COOPER**
 [On TV] Yeah, you could say that.

**ELI COOPER**
 [On TV] I'm here today to declare war on the Central Intelligence Agency and by extension, the entire United States government.

**ADAM**
 [On TV] Um... Uh... I'm... I'm having trouble understanding what you mean by that... um...

**ELI COOPER**
 [On TV] Then how about you shut the fuck up, Adam, and I'll make it crystal fucking clear for you, okay?

**ELI COOPER**
 [On TV] My son was a victim of a secret CIA program called Project Oxcart that was funded and overseen by your government. Now, I know most of you listening at home don't necessarily feel complicit in what the government does with your tax dollars behind closed doors, but that doesn't mean there aren't consequences, okay?

**ELI COOPER**
 [On TV] The government sure doesn't deserve any extra chances, but since I'm a nice guy, I'm gonna give them one. Twelve hours to track down every person who had anything to do with my son's death. From the people who were on the ground all the way up to those who approved it at the tippity-top.

**ELI COOPER**
 [On TV] I want apologies, and I want prosecution for those individuals. And if that doesn't happen, then I'll have to take justice into my own fucking hands. Again... I'm so sorry for all the swearing, Adam. I know this is a family program.

**ELI COOPER**
 [On TV] Thank you so much for letting me come on. I hope this can be an opportunity for us all to just heal together.

**ADAM**
 [On TV] Well... um... we're not really sure what to... um... We're gonna... we're gonna go to a commercial break and... we'll be right back.

**SAMANTHA**
 When was this?

**NIA**
 Like... 45 minutes ago? So whatever he's planning is going down around 9:00 AM tomorrow.

**SAMANTHA**
 Well then... we have to get moving. I mean, what are we doing here drinking beers with our shoes off?

**NIA**
 We're not doing anything. Which is exactly what we should be doing.

**SAMANTHA**
 What? But we have to stop him!

**NIA**
 No, we don't. It's not my job. And unless you got one hell of a plan to smooth things over with the CIA HR, it's not your job anymore either.

**SAMANTHA**
 You heard his demands. They're obviously unreasonable. Eli isn't negotiating, he's advertising. He wants the world watching when those bombs go off.

**NIA**
 So if we don't stop him and he blows up people responsible for Oxcart... so the fuck what? Fuck them.

**SAMANTHA**
 It won't just be them and you know it. Explosives aren't clean. Look, enough innocent people have already gotten hurt.

**NIA**
 Yeah, innocent people get hurt every day, Sam. If you care so fucking much, fucking join UNICEF.

**SAMANTHA**
 How could you be so cold? Eli killed the people we knew. The people who came from the same place as us.

**NIA**
 You think I don't know that, Sam? You think I'm not... fucking sitting here thinking about how I didn't get Curtis out of The Hive in time? I looked. Okay? I called out.

**NIA**
 I couldn't find him. I didn't check the kitchen, I... I forgot to. Or maybe I... shit, maybe I just left him to die to make sure I got out in time.

**NIA**
 I'm drinking a beer... because I'm trying to get my hands to stop fucking shaking.

**SAMANTHA**
 I'm sorry, Nia. But we're a part of this.

**SAMANTHA**
 I can't run away from it anymore.

**NIA**
 Yeah, well I sure can. I was on board with finding the Oxcart files, getting answers, but I didn't sign up for this. Shit. I mean whatever Eli's... whatever he's up to, we are clearly not a part of it anymore.

**NIA**
 And he already tried to kill me once. So when he finds out that we're trying to fuck with his plan, don't you think he'll use his considerable resources to make sure we're considerably dead?

**SAMANTHA**
 Not if he doesn't see us coming.

**NIA**
 I have barely escaped so many bad situations in my life and every time, I promised myself I'm not gonna fucking let it happen again. So this time I mean it. I mean it.

**SAMANTHA**
 There are people who depend on me, Sam. What happens to them if I get killed doing some... stupid vigilante shit?

**SAMANTHA**
 So, I even break me out if you don't want to help?

**NIA**
 I'm going to Arizona. And I want you to come with me. If you want. You see these printers? I'm putting together clean documents for both of us. I meant it when I said we make a good team.

**SAMANTHA**
 I know we do. That's why I need you. Look... the only lead I have is getting the Oxcart files.

**SAMANTHA**
 That's what you wanted anyway, right? Just help me get those and we can go our separate ways.

**NIA**
 So what's your plan? You put what... break into the archives where it's being held and steal the files?

**SAMANTHA**
 No, that's impossible. The files are being held in a special type of SCIF. It's not like Langley where there's hundreds of people with access. Only a handful of officers work there and everybody knows each other. And at this hour of night, there's no cover that could get us in and out.

**SAMANTHA**
 Maybe if we had a week to scout it, you know, find the vulnerabilities.

**NIA**
 Yeah, but not in twelve hours.

**SAMANTHA**
 No. But we do have access to the CIA records management office.

**SAMANTHA**
 You know, we could fake a request from an archivist and mark the file to be destroyed.

**NIA**
 Right, okay, so far so good. We delete our only lead and then what? Shoot ourselves?

**SAMANTHA**
 A year ago, the agency ran a study which determined that pages run through a level seven shredder could be reassembled with AI. So, they put a new protocol in place. All documents marked to be destroyed are placed in burn bags and transported by armored vehicle to a secure document destruction facility... where they will be incinerated.

**NIA**
 So instead of hacking into the archives, we hack the incineration facility and let the files come to us.

**SAMANTHA**
 Exactly.

**NIA**
 Fine. I'm on board. But just until we get the files.

**NIA**
 Sam?

**NIA**
 But if you get me killed... I will kill you.

**NIA**
 It's fucking hot in here.

**SAMANTHA**
 That's probably because of all the industrial incinerators.

**NIA**
 Yeah, I got that. I don't do this kind of heat though. Makes me sweat in all the wrong places.

**SAMANTHA**
 Copy that.

**SAMANTHA**
 Tracker says our guys should be pulling up to the loading bay now.

**NIA**
 Ooh. Easier than DoorDash.

**SAMANTHA**
 Not quite. Now comes the tricky part. Files are escorted by two armed guards and an agency witness who won't let it out of their sight until the last page is burned.

**NIA**
 Okay so we take their sight away. When we knock out the power, we got thirty seconds before the backup generator kicks in, yeah?

**SAMANTHA**
 The documentation says so, but realistically it's probably less. Maybe... fifteen seconds? That's why the timing has to be perfect.

**NIA**
 And if we miss that window, this swamp burns the files.

**SAMANTHA**
 The real files get burned, the truth of what happened to us gets lost forever and Eli detonates a couple hundred pounds of Semtex at an unknown location.

**NIA**
 Ugh. Fabulous. Guess we better not miss it then.

**SAMANTHA**
 The documents will be in the cart.

**NIA**
 Inside the cart? The locked cart?

**SAMANTHA**
 Said you can pick a lock fast.

**NIA**
 Well not that fast! Fifteen seconds? In the dark?

**GUARD 1**
 Lorenzo, Whitehead, come to the office for a second.

**GUARD 2**
 Hey, what about the cart?

**GUARD 1**
 Just leave it there, this will only take a second.

**SAMANTHA**
 Wait. What's going on? They're not supposed to leave the files.

**NIA**
 They fucked up. Now's our chance. Let's go.

**SAMANTHA**
 No, no. Something is wrong. Okay, where's the agency witness?

**NIA**
 Look, Sam, if we don't take this chance we might not get another one. Shit, I'm going.

**SAMANTHA**
 Nia! We are very exposed right now and I don't think you'll be able to finish before they come back.

**NIA**
 Okay, let's just cool it with the negative vibes, okay?

**SAMANTHA**
 Sorry. You've got this.

**NIA**
 Don't... don't talk.

**NIA**
 Ah! Look at that.

**NIA**
 Guess I could do it in under fifteen seconds.

**SAMANTHA**
 This is it!

**NIA**
 Let's just get out of here.

**ALDER (INTERROGATOR)**
 Need a ride?

**SAMANTHA**
 Brooks.

**BROOKS ALDER (INTERROGATOR)**
 Here's a pro tip. Next time you make an escape, don't tell your captor exactly where you're going next. Put a flag on this file the second I knew you were gone.

**BROOKS ALDER (INTERROGATOR)**
 I do applaud the inventiveness of sending it to be destroyed. It's risky. But pretty clever.

**NIA**
 Yeah, you practiced that line on the way over here didn't you?

**BROOKS ALDER (INTERROGATOR)**
 You must be Nia. Not quite so dead as I'd heard.

**SAMANTHA**
 You were on to us the whole time?

**SAMANTHA**
 Are these even the real files?

**BROOKS ALDER (INTERROGATOR)**
 They are, actually. They were already en route by the time I got caught up.

**BROOKS ALDER (INTERROGATOR)**
 I'm going to need you to set them down on the ground and put on these flexi-cuffs.

**BROOKS ALDER (INTERROGATOR)**
 Now, please.

**NIA**
 Ah, we could have been halfway to Arizona by now.

**BROOKS ALDER (INTERROGATOR)**
 You too, Sloane.

**BROOKS ALDER (INTERROGATOR)**
 What are you doing?

**SAMANTHA**
 Reading the Project Oxcart files.

**BROOKS ALDER (INTERROGATOR)**
 Sloane, I will shoot you.

**SAMANTHA**
 Then stop wasting your breath and shoot me. I have waited a long time to look at these and that's what I'm going to do.

**NIA**
 Is it?

**NIA**
 The real thing?

**BROOKS ALDER (INTERROGATOR)**
 You're just digging yourself into a deeper hole, Sloane.

**SAMANTHA**
 It's real.

**NIA**
 I know it.

**NIA**
 Those bastards.

**BROOKS ALDER (INTERROGATOR)**
 Enough! Enough of this nonsense! Put the cuffs on now! I won't warn you again.

**NIA**
 You still think this is nonsense? I was watching on the cameras when you were trying to gaslight her ass. But no, you've seen Eli's intentions. You met me. Me! Her fucking imaginary friend. And right here, we got the paperwork that backs up everything else Sam's been telling you.

**NIA**
 So why don't you get your head out of your fucking agency issued asshole and do something helpful for once?

**BROOKS ALDER (INTERROGATOR)**
 You don't think I have what it takes to pull this trigger?

**NIA**
 No, I don't, actually. I think you talk a big game, do those paper targets at the shooting range, and then come back and sharpen your pencils and write your little reports.

**SAMANTHA**
 Stop, Nia. If we're going to take down Eli, we need his help.

**SAMANTHA**
 Brooks, you have to read these files.

**BROOKS ALDER (INTERROGATOR)**
 You know that's not going to happen.

**SAMANTHA**
 I'll put on the cuffs. And we'll come in peacefully. I'm just asking you to look at it.

**BROOKS ALDER (INTERROGATOR)**
 Okay. You got a deal.

**NIA**
 What are you doing Sam? He's not going to help us.

**SAMANTHA**
 Yes he will.

**SAMANTHA**
 He said he will and I trust him.

**BROOKS ALDER (INTERROGATOR)**
 Step back. Both of you.

**BROOKS ALDER (INTERROGATOR)**
 Holy shit.

**SAMANTHA**
 The last twenty-five years of my life, every person I have told even a part of this to said I was crazy. With their words, with their eyes, with the way they treated me.

**SAMANTHA**
 And I heard it so often and so loudly that I started to believe it myself.

**BROOKS ALDER (INTERROGATOR)**
 No, Sam. You are not crazy.

**SAMANTHA**
 Now what?

**BROOKS ALDER (INTERROGATOR)**
 I'm gonna take you back to the office and we're gonna go through all these files together. I think you're right. It could help us figure out what Eli is planning.

**NIA**
 Okay, now that we're all on the same happy team, can we lose these bracelets?

**BROOKS ALDER (INTERROGATOR)**
 I didn't say we're on the same team. You're both wanted criminals right now and when this is said and done, you're still going to have to answer to that. Given the urgency of the situation, I'm willing to go down this path with you, but don't forget that you remain under my custody. Is that clear?

**NIA**
 Sure, buddy. You're in charge.

**SAMANTHA**
 Just as long as we find Eli.

**BROOKS ALDER (INTERROGATOR)**
 We'll find him. He's out there somewhere.

**BROOKS ALDER (INTERROGATOR)**
 Go for, Alder.

**BROOKS ALDER (INTERROGATOR)**
 Hello?

**BROOKS ALDER (INTERROGATOR)**
 Who is this?

**ELI COOPER**
 Hello, Brooks Alder. This is Eli Cooper.
