# Episode 2 - The Runaway

**LUMINARY**
 Input determines output. You have twenty minutes to eat your nutritional supplement. You must eat all of it. The supplements are individualized, so do not share them.

Ugh. Mine tastes like dirt.

Smells.

**LUMINARY**
 Do not speak at this time. Focus on eating.

**BEETLE**
 What name did they give you guys? I’m Beetle.

**RAPTOR**
 Raptor.

**HONEYBEE**
 Honeybee.

**BEETLE**
 What about you?

**YOUNG SAM (TETRA)**
 Tetra. But my real name is Sam Sloane.

**LUMINARY**
 Tetra. You are in violation of the rules.

**YOUNG SAM (TETRA)**
 I’m sorry! I forgot!

**BEETLE**
 It wasn’t her fault, I asked her!

**THE ASCENDANT**
 Luminary, please take Tetra and Beetle to the Enrichment Room.

**LUMINARY**
 Right away.

**YOUNG SAM (TETRA)**
 Please! Stop! Let me go, I didn't know! Let me go! Let me go! I didn't know! It's not my fault!

Peek-a-boo.

**SAMANTHA**
 I remember dropping the teacup. I remember staring up at the ceiling of my apartment and then... everything went black.

**INTERROGATOR**
 What’s the next thing you remember?

Morning, sunshine.

**SAMANTHA**
 The timing... Let me out! No!

Like... I think I’m just gonna sit right here until you chill the fuck out.

**SAMANTHA**
 Where am I?

You. Are. Nowhere. Say what you will about Eli, and I have plenty of my own thoughts there, but... he has spent a lot of money keeping this place hidden. As far as the world is concerned... you’ve already disappeared. And depending on how you act when I let you out of those handcuffs... you might stay disappeared. You feel me?

**SAMANTHA**
 I understand.

Great. Ugh. Eli wants me to give you the tour, so let’s go.

**SAMANTHA**
 The Hive was a high-tech bunker. A windowless labyrinth of hallways and rooms. I assumed I was underground, but I had no idea where. Could be a complex under the Marathon headquarters or... in a bomb shelter in North Carolina.

Easy on the eyes, isn't it? All black walls, dim floor lighting. Now, Eli would tell you that painting the walls black is optimal for improving focus.

**SAMANTHA**
 And what do you think?

I think somebody’s nerves watched too much Star Wars growing up. Those doors lead to the kitchen, over there is the gym, and— oh! Oh-ho! What a treat. Rare sighting of our resident tough guy, Gannon. Now before you ask, yes, he is wearing that cowboy hat completely unironically.

**GANNON**
 Fuck off, Nia.

**NIA**
 Oh! What’s the matter? Wake up with a snake in your boot?

**SAMANTHA**
 Nia. Nia Carter. That’s when I realized that my tour guide seemed so familiar. I’d seen her name on a dozen government watch lists. A notorious black-hat thief and by all accounts an extremely dangerous individual. And Nia was just one of seven hackers who had been living and working here twenty-four-seven for months.

**NIA**
 And right up there... is the exit door.

**SAMANTHA**
 It’s locked?

**NIA**
 And Eli is the only one who goes in and out. "Security purposes," he says.

**SAMANTHA**
 So we’re all prisoners in here.

**NIA**
 Hmm. Prisoners with twenty-three thousand dollar mattresses. Not sure if you noticed that superb back support when you were thrashing around all on yours.

**SAMANTHA**
 He must be paying you quite a lot of money for this to be worth it.

**NIA**
 I know I shit-talk Eli. I shit-talk everyone. But... believe it or not, I’m not here for the money. What we’re working on here, it’s... it’s important.

**SAMANTHA**
 What are you working on here?

**NIA**
 Nah... gotta ask Eli that. He wants to meet with you. He’s in the Sound Bath.

**SAMANTHA**
 Sound the what?

**ELI COOPER**
 Ooh, and feel that. There are one hundred and fifty speakers in the walls of this room firing vibrations from every angle. Do you feel it? I mean, you can’t get this kind of relaxation anywhere else.

**SAMANTHA**
 So you built this place to relax?

**ELI COOPER**
 You’d be surprised. You see, our work here has come to an end. Our preparations are almost in place. Of which you... are the final piece. Oh-ho-ho. I have waited so long for it to be done. This is almost bittersweet to be at an end. So I am savoring this moment.

**SAMANTHA**
 You said what you were working on here would be of interest to me. So, um... what is it?

**ELI COOPER**
 So direct! Please, Samara. Do yourself a favor. Take a few seconds and just... feel the room.

**SAMANTHA**
 Eli, I—

**ELI COOPER**
 Trust. Me. All right?

**SAMANTHA**
 I didn’t admit it to him at the time, but I already noticed the effect the room had on me. It made the ringing go away.

**INTERROGATOR**
 The ringing?

**SAMANTHA**
 Chronic tinnitus. I’ve had it since I was a child. The only way I’ve ever quieted it is through certain types of music. But being in this room took it to another level. Like... like it had been designed for just that purpose.

**ELI COOPER**
 Everybody has their own place in the Hive. Everybody has their own assignment. This... is yours.

**SAMANTHA**
 A broom?

**ELI COOPER**
 Well, we can’t exactly get janitorial staff out here.

**SAMANTHA**
 You brought me out here just to sweep the floors?

**ELI COOPER**
 Oh, no, no, no. Help in the kitchen as well.

**SAMANTHA**
 Eli, I took your coding test. I drank your tea. And now I’d like some answers as to what is going on.

**ELI COOPER**
 What you need to understand is the way things work around here. All right? You are not an employee. No, no, no. You are a soldier. You are not entitled to anything but that which is granted to you by my grace. I am a nice man! Really, I am. But I have extremely limited patience for people who try to undermine my work.

**SAMANTHA**
 I’m not here to undermine anything.

**ELI COOPER**
 You will get answers when you earn your spot on the team.

**SAMANTHA**
 If he wasn’t going to tell me what the Hive was working on, I’d have to find out myself. I didn’t have access to a computer. But over the next three weeks, I approached the problem as I would any locked system. Stay undetected. Move laterally. Look for vulnerabilities. Gaps in security. Anything out of place.

**SAMANTHA**
 Every day I wake up and make the team breakfast. The Hive’s kitchen is well-stocked. So well-stocked that nobody notices the lighter or knife I smuggle out in the sash. After breakfast, I do laundry. Outside the laundry room, I find an electrical panel that seems to control the lights. I don’t know what I might use it for but... like a misconfigured application, I make a mental note of it. Just in case.

**SAMANTHA**
 Most of the afternoon, I’m by myself. Eli set up the Hive so everyone is siloed into their own individual tasks with no knowledge of what the other groups are working on it. Another security measure. Most of the team spends the day locked in their rooms working. I take the opportunity to explore the place. Sweeping as I go. I examine what types of locks are on each door. Standard keypad locks on the bedroom doors. I check for cameras. I don’t see any. That doesn’t mean Eli isn’t listening. I count my steps to gauge the size of the facility.

**SAMANTHA**
 After dinner, the team congregates in the common area. That’s when I have a chance to get to know the hackers who make up the Hive. They’re brilliant. And weird. And damaged. Like most of us hackers are, to an extent. But with this group, it was... extreme.

**NIA**
 Did you guys shut the fuck up?

There they go again, again.

**SAMANTHA**
 Are they speaking a different language?

Curtis made it up. It was a fun side project for them to learn at first, but ever since they introduced swear words, things have been heated. You’re Samara, right? The new here? I’m Dylan. Nice to meet you, nice to meet you.

**SAMANTHA**
 Dylan was a short, twitchy guy who was always playing this online game where you guess locations based on Google Maps pictures. Apparently, he’s the world champion at it.

**DYLAN**
 Bulgaria. Costa Rica. Camino de Santiago.

**SAMANTHA**
 How did you know that?

**DYLAN**
 Scallop shell signs. Shell sign. Duh.

**SAMANTHA**
 How did you get so good at this game?

**DYLAN**
 When I was little... for a long time, my mom couldn’t take care of me and I got moved around a lot. Like... a lot, a lot. I started noticing what makes each place different.

**SAMANTHA**
 Must be tough for you. To be locked inside here.

**DYLAN**
 No. I like it. It’s the only place that’s ever felt like home. Like home. Eli is like a... a father to us. And we’re not all locked in here. Gannon goes out with Eli every couple weeks or so.

**SAMANTHA**
 Gannon goes out? To uh... do what?

**DYLAN**
 I don’t know. They’re in their own silo. But he brings back supplies. And medicine. Used to be Alan. Alan would bring me back my favorite chocolate. Chocolate. Gannon doesn’t do that.

**SAMANTHA**
 Who’s Alan?

**DYLAN**
 I’m sorry. I need to focus on the game now.

**SAMANTHA**
 If Gannon was in the same silo that Alan Dubeck was in, I figured that whatever he was working on might hold the key to Dubeck’s death. And the Hive’s purpose. And now I knew there were windows of time when he was out of his room. I just needed a way to get his pass-code.

**SAMANTHA**
 I didn’t have a computer or any other devices. But... I had a kitchen.

**SAMANTHA**
 How’s the food?

**DYLAN**
 Great. Great. You’re the best cook we’ve had here! Input determines output!

**GANNON**
 Nah, this fucking soggy. It wet the napkins up.

**SAMANTHA**
 Oh, sorry Gannon. We just ran out. I’ll have to get more from storage.

**GANNON**
 Forget it. I’m not hungry.

**SAMANTHA**
 When he went back to his room, I followed him. I made sure to keep my distance. Gannon was six-four and built like a lumberjack. According to Dylan, he’d been a dark web arms dealer prior to joining the Hive. Whatever Eli was working on, Gannon was clearly the muscle.

**SAMANTHA**
 Dinner that night had been seafood tacos. Gannon’s food probably didn’t taste as good because I drenched his whole plate in lemon juice. Because under a little bit of heat... lemon juice residue turns brown. I had to hold the flame right next to the keypad, and even then it was barely visible. But I could just make out the numbers he pressed. One. Five. Seven. Eight.

**SAMANTHA**
 I got my chance a few days later. Gannon had just left the Hive with Eli. I didn’t know how long I’d have until they returned. I went about my routine as usual... until it was time to sweep the hallways outside the living quarters. I knew the numbers, but not the order. Twenty-four potential combinations.

**SAMANTHA**
 The first thing I noticed was the laptops. Gannon had eight of them. All the same model stacked up on his desk. But what was stranger was that they weren’t common coding laptops. They were entry level. Notoriously vulnerable.

**SAMANTHA**
 It only took a couple minutes to get into one of them.

**INTERROGATOR**
 Okay. So, what was on the laptop?

**SAMANTHA**
 Nothing. It was brand new. Original factory settings and all. He hadn’t even set up the admin account. I checked the second laptop and got the same results. So I just gave up on the laptops and started going through the rest of his room.

**INTERROGATOR**
 And? Did you find anything interesting?

**SAMANTHA**
 Most of it was fairly ordinary. Some extremist literature, anarchist cookbook type stuff. But then I opened a cabinet above his bed.  Shit.

**INTERROGATOR**
 What fell out?

**SAMANTHA**
 A box of nine millimeter hollow points. Leaning against the door. I got them cleaned up but... by my count, it seemed like there were at least two clips worth already missing.

**ELI COOPER**
 Hey, Samara? Samara? Are you in there?

**ELI COOPER**
 Alright. Have you seen— have you seen Samara?

She was just sweeping around here.

**ELI COOPER**
 Okay. We need everybody downstairs right now. All hands on deck. Come on.

I’ll check the kitchen.

**SAMANTHA**
 I went down to the common area to find the team gathered around a single laptop hooked up to the projector screen.

**ELI COOPER**
 Ah-ha-ha! There you are, Samara! I’m so glad you’re here for this.

**SAMANTHA**
 Uh... what’s going on?

**ELI COOPER**
 Well, as you may know, at my day job, I’m the CEO of this big cybersecurity firm. Lots of responsibilities. Blah blah blah blah. To cut to the chase, one of Marathon’s clients just got hacked. For most cybersecurity companies, this would be a very serious matter that leads to a lot of stern meetings. Etc, etc, etc. But! Given the team I have assembled here... I like to use these as opportunities to, uh... you know. Blow off some steam.

**HACKERS**
 - OK. - Yes! That's ever since we did one of these. Let's go.

**ELI COOPER**
 I know, and Samara! Since you are new, you are going to be in the hot seat today. Come on. Come on up to the laptop.

**SAMANTHA**
 But what am I doing exactly?

**ELI COOPER**
 Yes. So pulled up on the computer is everything we know about the cyber intrusion that just took place, okay? I want you, along with the helpful suggestions of your lovely peers right here, to track down the person responsible for the hack, and punish them appropriately. Okay?

**ELI COOPER**
 I mean... you don’t have a problem with extra-judicial punishment, do you, Samara?

**SAMANTHA**
 Not at all.

**DYLAN**
 Current record for tracking down the culprit is thirty-four minutes.

**NIA**
 Please be faster than that. I got work to get back to.

**HACKERS**
 - Let’s see what you got. Go! - There’s no way she’s gonna do it. - Do we really have to do this?

**SAMANTHA**
 Maybe it was the pressure of the group, or maybe it was because it was my first time using a computer in weeks, but I was on fire that day. It took me fifteen minutes not only to find the hacker, but to pull up his live webcam.

**HACKERS**
 - Holy shit. - Oh my god. - Whoa. - Good, Samara. - Houston? We have visual.

**INTERROGATOR**
 Was this a terrorist cell or a summer camp?

**SAMANTHA**
 That was when I understood why all these people were okay being locked in the Hive. The real world sees us... I mean, we're outsiders and freaks. But somehow, Eli built a community here. Even without knowing what they were working towards, I could still feel it. I never felt that type of connection before. Certainly not in my time at the Agency.

**INTERROGATOR**
 If you never felt connected to the Agency, why were you even in the CIA to begin with?

**SAMANTHA**
 I asked myself that a lot when Michelle first brought me in. I considered leaving until my second year.

**SAMANTHA**
 Operation Exodus.

**SAMANTHA**
 Intelligence I'd gathered was crucial in bringing down one of the largest child trafficking networks in the world.

**SAMANTHA**
 You know protecting people who can't protect themselves... gave my life meaning.

**INTERROGATOR**
 Exodus was you? That was... that was good work.

**INTERROGATOR**
 Here. The medicine you came in with.

**SAMANTHA**
 Thank you.

**INTERROGATOR**
 Listen, Sloan. Sam. I know that you don't trust me. But I am here to listen to your story.

**INTERROGATOR**
 Down the line, after you leave this room... I can't promise that there will be other people who say the same. I need to know what happened to you. Everything.

**SAMANTHA**
 I... I... I never knew my parents. Been bounced around in foster homes for as long as I can remember.

**SAMANTHA**
 Wherever they put me, I would run away. Until I was about seven years old. And I ended up in a place that I couldn't run away from.

**INTERROGATOR**
 The Hollow Jungle?

**SAMANTHA**
 That's what I called it.

**INTERROGATOR**
 What is it?

**SAMANTHA**
My best guess? It was some kind of cult. Centered around technology enhancing the human brain. They tortured us. Um... messed with our heads. All under the direction of someone they called The Ascendant.

**SAMANTHA**
 Before you ask, I don't have any evidence of this. Believe me, I have looked over the past twenty five years. So many people have told me that I made the whole thing up... I almost started to believe it myself. I almost...

**INTERROGATOR**
 How long were you in there for?

**SAMANTHA**
 A year. But um... in some ways I never left. I still feel the effects of what they did to every day. Blackouts, seizures, headaches, tinnitus, light and sound sensitivity, night terrors. Not to mention the inability to connect with anyone or to fit in anywhere.

**INTERROGATOR**
 Until you got to the Hive.

**SAMANTHA**
 Yes. But even that didn't last long.

**DYLAN**
 Houston? We have visual.

**NIA**
 Jesus. He looks like he’s in tenth grade.

**ELI COOPER**\NOh come on. Never too young to learn.\N**HACKER**\NStupid kid.\N**ELI COOPER**\NAll right Samara! What’s your next move?

**SAMANTHA**
 Um... I could brick his computer and wipe all the data? That will teach him not to do it again.

**ELI COOPER**
 You could do that. And you’re the one on the controls. But if I’m being honest? That seems a little soft. Okay? What if you were to say, I don’t know... drain his parents' bank accounts? Or download bomb-making instructions to his computer and call SWAT?

**SAMANTHA**
 You want me to ruin this kid's life?

**ELI COOPER**
 What? It’s important to teach people lessons! It’s important to deliver justice in a fucked up world! In my opinion, scars are the best way to heal. Or you could just order a hundred pizzas to his house and call it even, okay? Up to you.

**GANNON**\NWhere’s that bitch?\N**HACKERS**\N- Oh my god.\N- Hey. What are you—?

**ELI COOPER**
 Gannon?

**GANNON**
 She went through my room!

**DYLAN**
 Oh my god! Gannon, stop!

**SAMANTHA**
 I don’t know what you’re talking about.

**GANNON**
 Oh yeah? Or you missed one of the bullets. Here. Take another.

**HACKERS**
 - What are you doing, dude? This isn't fine. - Gannon, what the fuck? - What are you, out of your fucking mind?

**GANNON**
 What are you really here for... Samara?

**HACKERS**\N- She was in the room with us...\N- Eli! She was right there.\N- She didn’t go to your room!\N**GANNON**\NWhat did you after.

**ELI COOPER**
 Hey, Gannon! Put the gun down.

**GANNON**
 I told you we couldn't trust her. It's too much of a risk to have her here.

**ELI COOPER**
 We need her.

**GANNON**
 No we don't! She's a risk we can't afford to take. You told me we was in this together, ain't it? Well I'm making an executive decision right now.

**HACKER**
 Put the gun down!

**NIA**
 Cut that cowboy shit, Gannon! You're not gonna shoot her.

**GANNON**
 Why wouldn't I? What, you gonna call the cops on me? I'm doing all us a huge favor. You got five seconds to move out the way, or I'mma drop you too.

**ELI COOPER**
 Gannon. Gannon. Come here.

**GANNON**
 Don't touch me.

**ELI COOPER**
 Listen to me. Come over here. Hey. OK. Hey. Look at me. Look at me. You're good.

**NIA**
 Samara? You okay?

**NIA**
 Come on, let’s go.

**NIA**
 Said... take two of these.

**SAMANTHA**
 I wasn’t in his room. Okay? He’s lying.

**NIA**
 As if I’d take anything Gannon says at his word. He’s gone off like that on every person here. Paranoid asshole. You okay?

**SAMANTHA**
 What did you give me?

**NIA**
 They help. Trust me.

**SAMANTHA**
 Yeah. How did you know what was happening to me?

**SAMANTHA**
 Oh shit. Here. Your nose is bleeding. Huh. I’ll be right back. You get one drop of blood on my sheets and I’mma kill you.

**SAMANTHA**
 The whole interaction was surprising. I mean, up until now, Nia had been nothing but cold to me. But for some reason she helped me through my episode. After she left though, I noticed that she’d left me alone in her room. Only a few feet away from her workstation. I knew I didn’t have long. But this was the opportunity I’d been waiting for. To find out what the Hive was really working on.

**INTERROGATOR**
 Okay. So you took advantage of her helping you to break into her work. It’s pretty cold, isn’t it?

**SAMANTHA**
 People shouldn’t trust me.

**INTERROGATOR**
 Did you get in? Did you find what she was working on?

**SAMANTHA**
 I only got a brief look, but that’s all it took to spot a snippet of familiar code. A digital signature. Unique to government networks.

**INTERROGATOR**
 What... what does that mean?

**SAMANTHA**
 It means that whatever the Hive was working on was designed to infiltrate a government network. Just by writing that code, they’d broken international law.

**INTERROGATOR**
 Why would they want to infiltrate a government network?

**SAMANTHA**
 I didn’t get a chance to find out. It turns out Nia must not have trusted me that much. Because she left an alarm on her computer. Something I’d later learn she called a "Squealer". And for good reason. It was a program that, when triggered, blasted a pre-recorded message across all audio-capable devices connected to the same network.

**ALARM VOICE**
 Step away from the computer! Someone’s on the computer! Step away from the computer!

**SAMANTHA**
 It would have been disorienting to anyone, but to someone overly sensitive to sound... it was overwhelming. It took me a moment to get my bearings, at which point I realized that... my cover had just been blown. And I had to get out of there.

**HACKERS**
 - Whoa! Hey! - Whoa, whoa.

**SAMANTHA**
 I stumbled to my room first. Grabbed the knife I’d stashed. I didn’t move to the exit door not yet. I ran the other way to the laundry room.

**SAMANTHA**
 Got to the electrical panel and I cut out the lights. All of them.

**SAMANTHA**
 With no windows, the Hive was pitch black.

**HACKER**
 Where’d she go? I can’t see anything!

**SAMANTHA**
 But I had made a mental map of the entire facility by that point. Thirty steps down this hallway, then left turn...

**HACKERS**
 - Someone find a flashlight! - Somebody give me a flashlight!

**HACKERS**
 - Shut up! She's... - Wait a minute! She’s coming this way! - No, I think she’s going for the door! - There she is. She's going for the exit.

**SAMANTHA**
 Fifty-four steps to the stairs. Twelve stairs to the door. I noticed before it was installed, the hinges faced inward. That’s a vulnerability if you aim to keep people locked inside. I used the knife to pop the door.

**HACKERS**
 - There she is! She’s at the exit! - Samara!

**SAMANTHA**
 Behind the first door was a second one. I could see daylight coming through. I had no idea what was on the other side. If I would come out in the Marathon building lobby, or in the middle of the countryside. But I had no choice but to run for it.

**SAMANTHA**
 What the fuck?

**SAMANTHA**
 I was wrong. I wasn’t underground this whole time. The Hive was actually located above an abandoned oil platform in the middle of the Chesapeake Bay. Another step forward and I would drop a couple hundred feet into the open ocean below.

**ELI COOPER**
 Samara! There’s nowhere to run! Oh! I see you’ve stolen one of my knives.

**SAMANTHA**
 I’m happy to return it to you.

**ELI COOPER**
 That’s not going to be necessary, Samara. Or... should I call you Sam? Samantha Sloane? Cyber Operations Officer for the CIA? Is that... is that correct? That’s right. I know who you are. In fact, I know everything about you, Sam. But that’s not why I brought you here. And let you run around investigating us these past few weeks. I did that because I wanted you to know who we are.

**SAMANTHA**
 You’re terrorists.

**ELI COOPER**
 Nope. Try again.

**NIA**
 You figured it out, haven’t you?

**ELI COOPER**
 Say it, Sam.

**SAMANTHA**
 You... you all come from the same place as me.

**NIA**
 It’s good to see you again. Tetra.

**ELI COOPER**
 I think you’ve earned your spot on the team.
